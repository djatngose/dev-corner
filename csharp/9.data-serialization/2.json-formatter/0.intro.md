# JsonConvert.SerializeObject and JsonConvert.DeserializeObject create a copy data?

`JsonConvert.SerializeObject and JsonConvert.DeserializeObject` both create new strings or byte arrays to represent the JSON data. So, while they use the original data to create the new representation, they do create a copy of the data.

If you have a performance-critical application that deals with large amounts of JSON data, using `Span<T> and Memory<T>` to process the data directly without creating a copy could potentially provide a performance benefit. However, it also requires careful management of the lifetime of the underlying data to ensure that it remains valid for as long as it is being used.

# what are utf8JsonReader, utf8JsonWriter and JsonNode? Why we need to understand it? what benefits?
Utf8JsonReader, Utf8JsonWriter, and JsonNode are classes and interfaces provided by the System.Text.Json namespace in .NET. They are used for reading, writing, and manipulating JSON data in a high-performance and memory-efficient manner.

Utf8JsonReader: It is a forward-only, read-only parser for processing JSON data. It allows you to efficiently read and parse JSON documents without needing to fully deserialize them into .NET objects. The Utf8JsonReader reads the JSON data sequentially and provides methods to extract values, navigate through the JSON structure, and handle different JSON data types.

Understanding Utf8JsonReader is beneficial because:

It allows you to efficiently process and extract specific data from large JSON documents without the overhead of full deserialization.
It provides a lightweight and performant alternative to full JSON deserialization when you only need to access specific parts of the JSON data.
It enables you to work with JSON data in a streaming fashion, which is useful when dealing with large data sets or when processing data in real-time.
Utf8JsonWriter: It is a non-cached, forward-only, and write-only JSON writer. It allows you to generate JSON documents by writing JSON tokens and values directly to a stream or a memory buffer. The Utf8JsonWriter offers various methods to write JSON objects, arrays, properties, and values while ensuring correct JSON formatting and escaping.

Understanding Utf8JsonWriter is beneficial because:

It provides a fast and efficient way to generate JSON data from .NET objects or data structures.
It allows you to control the JSON generation process and tailor it to specific requirements.
It enables you to write JSON data directly to a stream or memory buffer, which can be useful in scenarios such as network communication or writing JSON to files.
JsonNode: Although not a built-in class in System.Text.Json, JsonNode typically refers to a generic representation of a JSON node or a node in a JSON tree structure. It can be used to represent any JSON value, such as objects, arrays, strings, numbers, booleans, or null.

`Understanding JsonNode is beneficial because:`

It provides a flexible and generic way to work with JSON data without the need for explicit deserialization into strongly typed objects.
It allows you to dynamically traverse and manipulate JSON data structures.
It can be used in scenarios where the JSON structure is not known at compile-time or when dealing with arbitrary or dynamic JSON data.
By understanding these concepts and classes, you gain more control and flexibility in working with JSON data in .NET applications. You can optimize performance, efficiently process large JSON documents, generate JSON data, and handle dynamic or unknown JSON structures more effectively.
