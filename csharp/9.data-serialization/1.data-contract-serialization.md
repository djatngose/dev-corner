# Data Contract Serializer 
https://www.albahari.com/nutshell/DataContractSerializer.pdf
The data contract serializer supports a data contract model that helps you decouple the low-level details of the
types you want to serialize from the structure of the serialized data. This provides excellent version tolerance,
meaning you can deserialize data that was serialized from an earlier or later version of a type. You can even
deserialize types that have been renamed or moved to a different assembly.
The data contract serializer can cope with most object graphs, although it can require more assistance than the
binary serializer. It can also be used as a general-purpose tool for reading/writing XML files, if you’re flexible
on how the XML is structured. (If you need to store data in attribut

# Using the Serializers
After choosing a serializer, the next step is to attach attributes to the types and members you want to serialize.
At a minimum:
 Add the [DataContract] attribute to each type.
 Add the [DataMember] attribute to each member that you want to include. 

namespace SerialTest
{
 [DataContract] public class Person
 {
 [DataMember] public string Name;
 [DataMember] public int Age;
 }
}
These attributes are enough to make a type implicitly serializable through the data contract engine.
You can then explicitly serialize or deserialize an object instance by instantiating a serializer and calling
WriteObject or ReadObject:
```c#
Person p = new Person { Name = "Stacey", Age = 30 };
var ds = new DataContractSerializer (typeof (Person));
using (Stream s = File.Create ("person.xml"))
 ds.WriteObject (s, p); // Serialize
Person p2;
using (Stream s = File.OpenRead ("person.xml"))
 p2 = (Person) ds.ReadObject (s); // Deserialize
Console.WriteLine (p2.Name + " " + p2.Age); // Stacey 30 
```

# what the alternative solution using DataContractSerializer?
The DataContractSerializer is a commonly used serialization mechanism in C# for converting objects to XML or JSON format. However, there are alternative solutions available for serialization and deserialization. Here are a few popular alternatives:

`Newtonsoft.Json (Json.NET)`: Newtonsoft.Json is a widely used third-party library for JSON serialization and deserialization. It provides a more flexible and feature-rich approach compared to the built-in DataContractSerializer. Json.NET supports a variety of customization options, handles complex object graphs, and offers better performance in many scenarios.

`System.Text.Json`: Starting from .NET Core 3.0 and later, the System.Text.Json namespace provides built-in JSON serialization and deserialization capabilities. It offers a high-performance, low-allocation alternative to Json.NET with similar features and flexibility.

`XMLSerializer`: The XmlSerializer class is another built-in serialization mechanism in C# that can serialize objects to XML format. It provides a simple API for XML serialization and deserialization but has some limitations compared to the DataContractSerializer, such as limited support for data contracts and more restrictive serialization rules.
