# MemoryStream

`MemoryStream uses an array as a backing store`. This partly defeats the purpose of having a stream because the entire backing store must reside in memory at once. MemoryStream is still useful when you need random access to a nonseekable stream. If you know the source stream will be of a manageable size, you can copy it into a MemoryStream as follows:
```c#
  var ms = new MemoryStream();
    sourceStream.CopyTo (ms);
```
You can convert a MemoryStream to a byte array by calling ToArray. The GetBuffer method does the same job more efficiently by returning a direct reference to the underlying storage array; unfortunately, this array is usually longer than the streamâ€™s real length.

`Closing and flushing` a MemoryStream is optional. If you close a MemoryStream, you can no longer read or write to it, but you are still permitted to call ToArray to obtain the underlying data. Flush does absolutely nothing on a memory stream.

# what different filestream vs memorystream .net?

FileStream and MemoryStream are two classes in .NET that provide streams for reading from and writing to files and in-memory buffers, respectively.

The main difference between the two classes is that FileStream is used for accessing files on disk, while MemoryStream is used for manipulating data in memory.

FileStream provides a stream for reading from and writing to a file on disk. You can use it to open an existing file or create a new file, and then read from or write to that file using the Stream API. When you create a FileStream object, you specify the path to the file you want to open or create, and then specify whether you want to read, write, or both.

MemoryStream, on the other hand, provides a stream for reading from and writing to an in-memory buffer. You can use it to create a new buffer, write data to it, and then read that data back. Unlike FileStream, MemoryStream does not correspond to a file on disk, and all the data it contains is stored in memory.

Because MemoryStream operates entirely in memory, it can be faster than FileStream for certain types of operations, such as when you need to repeatedly read and write data from a buffer without performing disk I/O. However, MemoryStream is not well-suited for handling large amounts of data, since it stores all data in memory, which can lead to memory issues if the data is too large. In contrast, FileStream can handle very large files, since it only reads or writes data in small chunks at a time, and does not store the entire file in memory at once.
