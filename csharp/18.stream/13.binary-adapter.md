# Binary Adapters
BinaryReader and BinaryWriter read and write native data types: bool, byte, char, decimal, float, double, short, int, long, sbyte, ushort, uint, and ulong, as well as strings and arrays of the primitive data types.
Unlike StreamReader and StreamWriter, `binary adapters store primitive data types efficiently because they are represented in memory. So, an int uses four bytes; a double uses eight bytes`. Strings are written through a text encoding (as with StreamReader and StreamWriter) but are length-prefixed to make it possible to read back a series of strings without needing special delimiters.
Imagine that we have a simple type, defined as follows:
    public class Person
    {
      public string Name;
      public int    Age;
      public double Height;
}
We can add the following methods to Person to save/load its data to/from a stream
using binary adapters:
    public void SaveData (Stream s)
    {
}
var w = new BinaryWriter (s); w.Write (Name);
w.Write (Age);
w.Write (Height);
w.Flush();
// Ensure the BinaryWriter buffer is cleared. // We won't dispose/close it, so more data // can be written to the stream.
public void LoadData (Stream s)
{
var r = new BinaryReader (s); Name = r.ReadString();
Age = r.ReadInt32(); Height = r.ReadDouble();
}

BinaryReader can also read into byte arrays. The following reads the entire contents of a seekable stream:
    byte[] data = new BinaryReader (s).ReadBytes ((int) s.Length);
This is more convenient than reading directly from a stream because it doesnâ€™t require a loop to ensure that all data has been read.
