# Timeouts
A stream supports read and write timeouts if CanTimeout returns true. `Network streams support timeouts; file and memory streams do not`. For streams that sup‚Äê port timeouts, the ReadTimeout and WriteTimeout properties determine the desired timeout in milliseconds, where 0 means no timeout. The Read and Write methods indicate that a timeout has occurred by throwing an exception.
The asynchronous ReadAsync/WriteAsync methods do not support timeouts; instead you can pass a cancellation token into these methods.
