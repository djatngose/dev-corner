# Using Streams
The abstract Stream class is the base for all streams. It defines methods and prop‚Äê erties for three fundamental operations: reading, writing, and seeking, as well as for administrative tasks such as closing, flushing, and configuring timeouts
```c#
public abstract bool CanRead { get; }
public abstract int Read (byte[] buffer, int offset, int count)
public virtual int ReadByte();
Writing
public abstract bool CanWrite { get; }
public abstract void Write (byte[] buffer, int offset, int count);
Seeking
public virtual void WriteByte (byte value); public abstract bool CanSeek { get; } public abstract long Position { get; set; } public abstract void SetLength (long value); public abstract long Length { get; }
public abstract long Seek (long offset, SeekOrigin origin); public virtual void Close();
Closing/ flushing
public void Dispose();
public abstract void Flush();
Timeouts
public virtual bool CanTimeout { get; }
public virtual int ReadTimeout { get; set; }
public virtual int WriteTimeout { get; set; } public static readonly Stream Null;
Other
Members
 // "Null" stream public static Stream Synchronized (Stream stream);
```
There are also asynchronous versions of the Read and Write methods, both of which return Tasks and optionally accept a cancellation token, and overloads that work with Span<T> and Memory<T> types 
```c#
using System;
    using System.IO;
// Create a file called test.txt in the current directory: using (Stream s = new FileStream ("test.txt", FileMode.Create)) {
}
Console.WriteLine (s.CanRead);
Console.WriteLine (s.CanWrite);
Console.WriteLine (s.CanSeek);
s.WriteByte (101);
s.WriteByte (102);
byte[] block = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
s.Write (block, 0, block.Length);
Console.WriteLine (s.Length); Console.WriteLine (s.Position); s.Position = 0;
Console.WriteLine (s.ReadByte());
Console.WriteLine (s.ReadByte());
// Read from the stream back into
Console.WriteLine (s.Read (block, 0, block.Length));
// Assuming the last Read returned 5, we'll be at
// the end of the file, so Read will now return 0:
Console.WriteLine (s.Read (block, 0, block.Length));
Reading or writing asynchronously is simply a question of calling ReadAsync/Write Async instead of Read/Write, and awaiting the expression (we must also add the async keyword to the calling method, as we described in Chapter 14):
async static void AsyncDemo() {
      using (Stream s = new FileStream ("test.txt", FileMode.Create))
      {
byte[] block = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
await s.WriteAsync (block, 0, block.Length); // Write asychronously
} }
s.Position = 0;                       // Move back to the start
// Read from the stream back into the block array:
Console.WriteLine (await s.ReadAsync (block, 0, block.Length));
// 5
// True
// True
// True
 // Write block of 5 bytes
 // 7
 // 7
 // Move back to the start
// 101 // 102
the block array:
// 5
// 0
```
