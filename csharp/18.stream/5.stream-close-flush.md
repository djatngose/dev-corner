# Closing and Flushing
Streams must be disposed after use to release underlying resources such as file and socket handles. A simple way to guarantee this is by instantiating streams within using blocks. In general, streams follow standard disposal semantics:
  - Dispose and Close are identical in function.
  - Disposing or closing a stream repeatedly causes no error.


Closing a decorator stream closes both the decorator and its backing store stream. With a chain of decorators, closing the outermost decorator (at the head of the chain) closes the whole lot.
Some streams internally buffer data to and from the backing store to lessen round- tripping and so improve performance (file streams are a good example of this). This means that data you write to a stream might not hit the backing store immediately; it can be delayed as the buffer fills up. The Flush method forces any internally buf‚Äê fered data to be written immediately. Flush is called automatically when a stream is closed, so you never need to do the following:
```c#
    s.Flush(); s.Close();
```

The `Flush()` method is used to ensure that any data in the buffer of the stream is written to the underlying data source, while the Close() method is used to close the stream and release any resources associated with it.

In most cases, it is not necessary to call Flush() before calling Close(), because Close() will automatically flush the stream before closing it. Additionally, calling Flush() and Close() can have unintended consequences if the stream is being used by multiple components or if there are exceptions during the write operation.

In fact, in some cases`, calling Flush() before Close() can actually result in data loss`. For example, if you are writing to a network stream and call Flush() before Close(), the data may not be fully transmitted before the connection is closed.

Therefore, it is `generally recommended to only call Close() on a stream and avoid calling Flush() `unless you have a specific reason to do so. If you want to ensure that all data is written to the stream before closing it, you can simply call `Close() and let it handle the flushing for you`.
