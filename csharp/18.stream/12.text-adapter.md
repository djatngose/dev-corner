# Stream Adapters
A Stream deals only in bytes; to read or write data types such as strings, integers, or XML elements, you must plug in an adapter. Here’s what .NET provides:
Text adapters (for string and character data)
```c#
TextReader, TextWriter StreamReader, StreamWriter StringReader, StringWriter
Binary adapters (for primitive types such as int, bool, string, and float) BinaryReader, BinaryWriter
XML adapters (covered in Chapter 11) XmlReader, XmlWriter
```

# Text Adapters
TextReader and TextWriter are the abstract base classes for adapters that deal exclusively with characters and strings. Each has two general-purpose implementa‐ tions in .NET:
`StreamReader/StreamWriter`
Uses a Stream for its raw data store, translating the stream’s bytes into charac‐ ters or strings
`StringReader/StringWriter`
Implements TextReader/TextWriter using in-memory strings

TextWriter has analogous methods for writing, as shown in Table 15-3. The Write and WriteLine methods are additionally overloaded to accept every primitive type, plus the object type. These methods simply call the ToString method on whatever is passed in (optionally through an IFormatProvider specified either when calling the method or when constructing the TextWriter).

# StreamReader and StreamWriter
In the following example, a StreamWriter writes two lines of text to a file, and then a StreamReader reads the file back:
    using (FileStream fs = File.Create ("test.txt"))
    using (TextWriter writer = new StreamWriter (fs))
    {
      writer.WriteLine ("Line1");
      writer.WriteLine ("Line2");
    }
    using (FileStream fs = File.OpenRead ("test.txt"))
    using (TextReader reader = new StreamReader (fs))
    {
      Console.WriteLine (reader.ReadLine());       // Line1
      Console.WriteLine (reader.ReadLine());       // Line2
    }
Because text adapters are so often coupled with files, the File class provides the static methods CreateText, AppendText, and OpenText to shortcut the process:
    using (TextWriter writer = File.CreateText ("test.txt"))
    {
      writer.WriteLine ("Line1");
      writer.WriteLine ("Line2");
    }
    using (TextWriter writer = File.AppendText ("test.txt"))
      writer.WriteLine ("Line3");
    using (TextReader reader = File.OpenText ("test.txt"))
      while (reader.Peek() > -1)
        Console.WriteLine (reader.ReadLine());     // Line1
                                                   // Line2
                                                   // Line3

This also illustrates how to test for the end of a file (viz. reader.Peek()). Another option is to read until reader.ReadLine returns null.
You can also read and write other types such as integers, but because TextWriter invokes ToString on your type, you must parse a string when reading it back:
    using (TextWriter w = File.CreateText ("data.txt"))
    {
      w.WriteLine (123);          // Writes "123"
      w.WriteLine (true);         // Writes the word "true"
    }
    using (TextReader r = File.OpenText ("data.txt"))
    {
      int myInt = int.Parse (r.ReadLine());     // myInt == 123
      bool yes = bool.Parse (r.ReadLine());     // yes == true
    }

# Character encodings
TextReader and TextWriter are by themselves just abstract classes with no connec‐ tion to a stream or backing store. The StreamReader and StreamWriter types, however, are connected to an underlying byte-oriented stream, so they must convert between characters and bytes. They do so through an Encoding class from the System.Text namespace, which you choose when constructing the StreamReader or StreamWriter. If you choose none, the default UTF-8 encoding is used.


# StringReader and StringWriter
The StringReader and StringWriter adapters don’t wrap a stream at all; instead, they use a string or StringBuilder as the underlying data source. This means no byte translation is required—in fact, the classes do nothing you couldn’t easily achieve with a string or StringBuilder coupled with an index variable. Their advantage, though, is that they share a base class with StreamReader/StreamWriter. For instance, suppose that we have a string containing XML and want to parse it with an XmlReader. The XmlReader.Create method accepts one of the following:

• AURI
• AStream
• ATextReader
So, how do we XML-parse our string? Because StringReader is a subclass of TextReader, we’re in luck. We can instantiate and pass in a StringReader as follows:
    XmlReader r = XmlReader.Create (new StringReader (myString));


StreamReader and StringReader are both classes in .NET that allow you to read character data from a stream or string, respectively.

The main difference between them is that StreamReader reads character data from a stream, while StringReader reads character data from a string.

Here's an example:

```c#
// Reading from a file using StreamReader
using (var streamReader = new StreamReader("example.txt"))
{
    string line;
    while ((line = streamReader.ReadLine()) != null)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(line);
    }
}

// Reading from a string using StringReader
string text = "Hello, world!";
using (var stringReader = new StringReader(text))
{
    int ch;
    while ((ch = stringReader.Read()) != -1)
    {
        Console.Write((char)ch);
    }
}
```
In the first example, we use StreamReader to read lines of text from a file. In the second example, we use StringReader to read character data from a string
