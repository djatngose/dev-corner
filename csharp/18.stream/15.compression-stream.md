# Compression Streams
Two general-purpose compression streams are provided in the System.IO.Compres sion namespace: `DeflateStream and GZipStream`. Both use a popular compression algorithm similar to that of the ZIP format. They differ in that `GZipStream` writes an additional protocol at the start and end—including a CRC to detect errors. `GZipStream` also conforms to a standard recognized by other software.

.NET also includes `BrotliStream`, which implements the Brotli compression algo‐ rithm. `BrotliStream is more than 10 times slower than DeflateStream and GZip Stream but achieves a better compression ratio`. (The performance hit applies only to compression—decompression performs very well.)
All three streams allow reading and writing, with the following provisos:
• You always write to the stream when compressing.
• You always read from the stream when decompressing.

DeflateStream, GZipStream, and BrotliStream are decorators; they compress or decompress data from another stream that you supply in construction. In the fol‐ lowing example, we compress and decompress a series of bytes using a FileStream as the backing store:
```c#
    using (Stream s = File.Create ("compressed.bin"))
    using (Stream ds = new DeflateStream (s, CompressionMode.Compress))
      for (byte i = 0; i < 100; i++)
        ds.WriteByte (i);
    using (Stream s = File.OpenRead ("compressed.bin"))
    using (Stream ds = new DeflateStream (s, CompressionMode.Decompress))
for (byte i = 0; i < 100; i++)
Console.WriteLine (ds.ReadByte()); // Writes 0 to 99
```

With DeflateStream, the compressed file is 102 bytes; slightly larger than the origi‐ nal (BrotliStream would compress it to 73 bytes). Compression works poorly with “dense,” nonrepetitive binary data (and worst of all with encrypted data, which lacks regularity by design). It works well with most text files; in the next example, we compress and decompress a text stream composed of 1,000 words chosen randomly from a small sentence with the Brotli algorithm. This also demonstrates chaining a backing store stream, a decorator stream, and an adapter (as depicted at the start of the chapter in Figure 15-1), and the use of asynchronous methods:
```c#
 string[] words = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog".Split();
    Random rand = new Random (0);   // Give it a seed for consistency
    using (Stream s = File.Create ("compressed.bin"))
    using (Stream ds = new BrotliStream (s, CompressionMode.Compress))
    using (TextWriter w = new StreamWriter (ds))
      for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
        await w.WriteAsync (words [rand.Next (words.Length)] + " ");
    Console.WriteLine (new FileInfo ("compressed.bin").Length);      // 808
    using (Stream s = File.OpenRead ("compressed.bin"))
    using (Stream ds = new BrotliStream (s, CompressionMode.Decompress))
    using (TextReader r = new StreamReader (ds))
      Console.Write (await r.ReadToEndAsync());  // Output below:
```

# Compressing in Memory
Sometimes, you need to compress entirely in memory. Here’s how to use a Memory Stream for this purpose:
```c#
    byte[] data = new byte[1000];          // We can expect a good compression
                                           // ratio from an empty array!
    var ms = new MemoryStream();
    using (Stream ds = new DeflateStream (ms, CompressionMode.Compress))
      ds.Write (data, 0, data.Length);
    byte[] compressed = ms.ToArray();
    Console.WriteLine (compressed.Length);       // 11
    // Decompress back to the data array:
    ms = new MemoryStream (compressed);
    using (Stream ds = new DeflateStream (ms, CompressionMode.Decompress))
      for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i += ds.Read (data, i, 1000 - i));
```

The using statement around the DeflateStream closes it in a textbook fashion, flushing any unwritten buffers in the process. This also closes the MemoryStream it wraps—meaning we must then call ToArray to extract its data.
Here’s an alternative that avoids closing the MemoryStream and uses the asynchro‐ nous read and write methods:
```c#
    byte[] data = new byte[1000];
MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream();
using (Stream ds = new DeflateStream (ms, CompressionMode.Compress, true))
      await ds.WriteAsync (data, 0, data.Length);
    Console.WriteLine (ms.Length);             // 113
    ms.Position = 0;
    using (Stream ds = new DeflateStream (ms, CompressionMode.Decompress))
      for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i += await ds.ReadAsync (data, i, 1000 - i));
```
The additional flag sent to DeflateStream’s constructor instructs it to not follow the usual protocol of taking the underlying stream with it in disposal. In other words, the MemoryStream is left open, allowing us to position it back to zero and reread it.

# Unix gzip File Compression
GZipStream’s compression algorithm is popular on Unix systems as a file compres‐ sion format. Each source file is compressed into a separate target file with a .gz extension.
The following methods do the work of the Unix command-line gzip and gunzip utilities:
```c#
    async Task GZip (string sourcefile, bool deleteSource = true)
    {
      var gzipfile = $"{sourcefile}.gz";
      if (File.Exists (gzipfile))
        throw new Exception ("Gzip file already exists");
// Compress
using (FileStream inStream = File.Open (sourcefile, FileMode.Open))
using (FileStream outStream = new FileStream (gzipfile, FileMode.CreateNew))
   using (GZipStream gzipStream =
        new GZipStream (outStream, CompressionMode.Compress))
        await inStream.CopyToAsync (gzipStream);
      if (deleteSource) File.Delete(sourcefile);
    }
    async Task GUnzip (string gzipfile, bool deleteGzip = true)
    {
      if (Path.GetExtension (gzipfile) != ".gz")
        throw new Exception ("Not a gzip file");
      var uncompressedFile = gzipfile.Substring (0, gzipfile.Length - 3);
      if (File.Exists (uncompressedFile))
        throw new Exception ("Destination file already exists");
      // Uncompress
      using (FileStream uncompressToStream =
             File.Open (uncompressedFile, FileMode.Create))
      using (FileStream zipfileStream = File.Open (gzipfile, FileMode.Open))
      using (var unzipStream =
             new GZipStream (zipfileStream, CompressionMode.Decompress))
        await unzipStream.CopyToAsync (uncompressToStream);
      if (deleteGzip) File.Delete (gzipfile);
    }
```

# when to use DeflateStream or GZipStream in .net?

Here are some guidelines on when to use DeflateStream or GZipStream in .NET:

If you're compressing a small amount of data (less than 1 MB), use DeflateStream. It's faster and more lightweight than GZipStream.
If you're compressing a large amount of data (more than 1 MB), use GZipStream. It provides better compression ratios than DeflateStream, but it's also slower and more memory-intensive.
If you're compressing a file or multiple files, use GZipStream. It can handle file compression and decompression, while DeflateStream can only compress and decompress streams of data.
Here's an example of using DeflateStream to compress a string:

```c#
string inputString = "Hello, world!";
byte[] inputData = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(inputString);

using (var outputStream = new MemoryStream())
using (var deflateStream = new DeflateStream(outputStream, CompressionMode.Compress))
{
    deflateStream.Write(inputData, 0, inputData.Length);
    deflateStream.Close();
    
    byte[] outputData = outputStream.ToArray();
    Console.WriteLine($"Compressed data: {Convert.ToBase64String(outputData)}");
}
```
And here's an example of using GZipStream to compress a file:

c#
Copy code
string sourceFile = "input.txt";
string destinationFile = "output.gz";

using (var sourceStream = new FileStream(sourceFile, FileMode.Open))
using (var destinationStream = new FileStream(destinationFile, FileMode.Create))
using (var gzipStream = new GZipStream(destinationStream, CompressionMode.Compress))
{
    sourceStream.CopyTo(gzipStream);
}
In this example, we're compressing the contents of input.txt using GZipStream and writing the compressed data to output.gz. Note that we're using CopyTo to copy the contents of sourceStream to gzipStream.

# Working with ZIP Files
The ZipArchive and ZipFile classes in System.IO.Compression support the ZIP compression format. The advantage of the ZIP format over DeflateStream and GZipStream is that it acts as a container for multiple files and is compatible with ZIP files created with Windows Explorer.
ZipArchive and ZipFile work in both Windows and Unix; however, the format is most popular in Windows. In Unix, the .tar format is more popular as a container for multiple files. You can read/write .tar files using a third-party library such as SharpZipLib.
ZipArchive works with streams, whereas ZipFile addresses the more common scenario of working with files. (ZipFile is a static helper class for ZipArchive.)
ZipFile’s CreateFromDirectory method adds all the files in a specified directory into a ZIP file:
    ZipFile.CreateFromDirectory (@"d:\MyFolder", @"d:\archive.zip");

ExtractToDirectory does the opposite and extracts a ZIP file to a directory: ZipFile.ExtractToDirectory (@"d:\archive.zip", @"d:\MyFolder");
When compressing, you can specify whether to optimize for file size or speed as well as whether to include the name of the source directory in the archive. Enabling the latter option in our example would create a subdirectory in the archive called MyFolder into which the compressed files would go.
ZipFile has an Open method for reading/writing individual entries. This returns a ZipArchive object (which you can also obtain by instantiating ZipArchive with a Stream object). When calling Open, you must specify a filename and indicate whether you want to Read, Create, or Update the archive. You can then enumer‐ ate existing entries via the Entries property or find a particular file by calling GetEntry:
    using (ZipArchive zip = ZipFile.Open (@"d:\zz.zip", ZipArchiveMode.Read))
      foreach (ZipArchiveEntry entry in zip.Entries)
        Console.WriteLine (entry.FullName + " " + entry.Length);
ZipArchiveEntry also has a Delete method, an ExtractToFile method (this is actually an extension method in the ZipFileExtensions class), and an Open method that returns a readable/writable Stream. You can create new entries by calling CreateEntry (or the CreateEntryFromFile extension method) on the ZipArchive. The following creates the archive d:\zz.zip, to which it adds foo.dll, under a directory structure within the archive called bin\X86:
    byte[] data = File.ReadAllBytes (@"d:\foo.dll");
    using (ZipArchive zip = ZipFile.Open (@"d:\zz.zip", ZipArchiveMode.Update))
zip.CreateEntry (@"bin\X64\foo.dll").Open().Write (data, 0, data.Length);
