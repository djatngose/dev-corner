# Formatting and Parsing
Formatting means converting to a string; parsing means converting from a string. The need to format or parse arises frequently in programming, in a variety of situations. Hence, .NET provides a variety of mechanisms:

`ToString and Parse`
These methods provide default functionality for many types.
`Format providers`
These manifest as additional ToString (and Parse) methods that accept a format string and/or a format provider. Format providers are highly flexible and culture-aware. .NET includes format providers for the numeric types and DateTime/DateTimeOffset.
`XmlConvert`
This is a static class with methods that format and parse while honoring XML standards. XmlConvert is also useful for general-purpose conversion when you need culture independence or you want to preempt misparsing. XmlConvert supports the numeric types, bool, DateTime, DateTimeOffset, TimeSpan, and Guid.
`Type converters`
These target designers and XAML parsers.
In this section, we discuss the first two mechanisms, focusing particularly on format providers. We then describe XmlConvert, type converters, and other conversion mechanisms.

# ToString and Parse
The simplest formatting mechanism is the ToString method. It gives meaningful output on all simple value types (bool, DateTime, DateTimeOffset, TimeSpan, Guid, and all the numeric types). For the reverse operation, each of these types defines a static Parse method:
```c#
string s = true.ToString();     // s = "True"
bool b = bool.Parse (s);        // b = true
```
If the parsing fails, a FormatException is thrown. Many types also define a TryParse method, which returns false if the conversion fails rather than throwing an exception:
```c#
bool failure = int.TryParse ("qwerty", out int i1);
bool success = int.TryParse ("123", out int i2);
```
If you don’t care about the output and want to test only whether parsing would succeed, you can use a discard:
```c#
bool success = int.TryParse ("123", out int _);
```
If you anticipate an error, calling TryParse is faster and more elegant than calling Parse in an exception handling block.

The Parse and TryParse methods on DateTime(Offset) and the numeric types respect local culture settings; you can change this by specifying a CultureInfo object. Specifying invariant culture is often a good idea. For instance, parsing “1.234” into a double gives us 1234 in Germany:
```c#
Console.WriteLine (double.Parse ("1.234"));   // 1234  (In Germany)
```
This is because in Germany, the period indicates a thousands separator rather than a decimal point. Specifying invariant culture fixes this:
```c#
double x = double.Parse ("1.234", CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
The same applies when calling ToString():

string x = 1.234.ToString (CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
```
# should we use int.Parse or double.parse, decimal.parse with CultureInfo.InvariantCulture?

It is generally recommended to use int.Parse with the appropriate CultureInfo that matches the format of the string being parsed.

If you use int.Parse without specifying a CultureInfo, the method will use the current thread's culture settings to parse the string. This can lead to unexpected behavior if the string is formatted differently from the current culture settings.

In cases where the format of the string is fixed and known, it is best to use int.Parse with CultureInfo.InvariantCulture. This ensures that the string is parsed using a culture-independent format, which is useful when working with data that may be shared across different cultures and regions.

However, if the format of the string is dynamic or unknown, it is recommended to use int.TryParse with the appropriate CultureInfo to handle any parsing errors and avoid runtime exceptions.

If we don't use CultureInfo.InvariantCulture when parsing an integer, it can lead to incorrect results or an exception in cases where the string representation of the integer uses a different format than the current culture settings.

For example, if the current culture settings specify a comma as the decimal separator, parsing the string "1234" using int.Parse would throw a FormatException, because it expects the decimal separator to be a period. However, if we use int.Parse with CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, it will correctly parse the string as the integer value 1234.
```c#
using System;
using System.Globalization;

class Program {
    static void Main() {
        // Current culture settings specify a comma as decimal separator
        var currentCulture = CultureInfo.CurrentCulture;
        Console.WriteLine("Current culture: " + currentCulture.Name);

        // String representation of integer uses period as decimal separator
        var integerString = "1234.0";

        // Using int.Parse with current culture throws a FormatException
        try {
            var integer1 = int.Parse(integerString);
            Console.WriteLine("Parsed integer 1: " + integer1);
        }
        catch (FormatException ex) {
            Console.WriteLine("FormatException: " + ex.Message);
        }

        // Using int.Parse with CultureInfo.InvariantCulture succeeds
        var integer2 = int.Parse(integerString, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
        Console.WriteLine("Parsed integer 2: " + integer2);
    }
}

```
Output:
```c#
Current culture: en-US
FormatException: Input string was not in a correct format.
Parsed integer 2: 1234

```
In this example, the current culture settings are en-US, which uses a comma as the decimal separator. The string representation of the integer uses a period as the decimal separator. When we try to parse the string using int.Parse with the current culture, it throws a FormatException. However, when we use int.Parse with CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, it succeeds in parsing the integer value.

# Format Providers
Sometimes, you need more control over how formatting and parsing take place. There are dozens of ways to format a DateTime(Offset), for instance. Format providers allow extensive control over formatting and parsing, and are supported for numeric types and date/times. Format providers are also used by user interface controls for formatting and parsing.

The gateway to using a format provider is IFormattable. All numeric types—and DateTime(Offset)—implement this interface:

public interface IFormattable
{
  string ToString (string format, IFormatProvider formatProvider);
}
The first argument is the format string; the second is the format provider. The format string provides instructions; the format provider determines how the instructions are translated. For example:

NumberFormatInfo f = new NumberFormatInfo();
f.CurrencySymbol = "$$";
Console.WriteLine (3.ToString ("C", f));          // $$ 3.00
Here, `"C"` is a format string that indicates currency, and the NumberFormatInfo object is a format provider that determines how currency—and other numeric representations—are rendered. This mechanism allows for globalization.

If you specify a null format string or provider, a default is applied. The default format provider is CultureInfo.CurrentCulture, which, unless reassigned, reflects the computer’s runtime control panel settings. For example, on this computer:
```c#
Console.WriteLine (10.3.ToString ("C", null));  // $10.30
```
For convenience, most types overload ToString such that you can omit a null provider:

Console.WriteLine (10.3.ToString ("C"));     // $10.30
Console.WriteLine (10.3.ToString ("F4"));    // 10.3000 (Fix to 4 D.P.)

Calling ToString on a DateTime(Offset) or a numeric type with no arguments is equivalent to using a default format provider, with an empty format string.

.NET defines three format providers (all of which implement IFormatProvider):
```c#
NumberFormatInfo
DateTimeFormatInfo
CultureInfo
```

`Note`: All enum types are also formattable, though there’s no special IFormatProvider class.

# Format providers and CultureInfo
Within the context of format providers, CultureInfo acts as an indirection mechanism for the other two format providers, returning a NumberFormatInfo or Date​Ti⁠meFormatInfo object applicable to the culture’s regional settings.

In the following example, we request a specific culture (english language in Great Britain):
```c#
CultureInfo uk = CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo ("en-GB");
Console.WriteLine (3.ToString ("C", uk));      // £3.00
```
This executes using the default NumberFormatInfo object applicable to the en-GB culture.

The next example formats a DateTime with invariant culture. Invariant culture is always the same, regardless of the computer’s settings:
```c#
DateTime dt = new DateTime (2000, 1, 2);
CultureInfo iv = CultureInfo.InvariantCulture;
Console.WriteLine (dt.ToString (iv));            // 01/02/2000 00:00:00
Console.WriteLine (dt.ToString ("d", iv));       // 01/02/2000
```
`Note:`
`Invariant culture is based on American culture`, with the following differences:
  - The currency symbol is `☼ instead of $`.
  - Dates and times are formatted with leading zeros (though still with the month first).
    - Formatting dates and times with leading zeros means that if a number has fewer digits than the maximum number of digits allowed, the remaining digits are filled with leading zeros. For example, formatting the day of the month as "dd" in the format string will ensure that single-digit days are displayed with a leading zero, such as "01" for the first day of the month, "02" for the second day, and so on.
    - Using leading zeros in date and time formatting ensures that the resulting string has a consistent and predictable length, which can be helpful in certain scenarios such as sorting and comparison.
  - `Time uses the 24-hour format rather than an AM/PM designato`r.

# Using NumberFormatInfo or DateTimeFormatInfo
In the next example, we instantiate a NumberFormatInfo and change the group separator from a comma to a space. We then use it to format a number to three decimal places:
```c#
NumberFormatInfo f = new NumberFormatInfo ();
f.NumberGroupSeparator = " ";
Console.WriteLine (12345.6789.ToString ("N3", f));   // 12 345.679
```
The initial settings for a NumberFormatInfo or DateTimeFormatInfo are based on the invariant culture. Sometimes, however, it’s more useful to choose a different starting point. To do this, you can Clone an existing format provider:

NumberFormatInfo f = (NumberFormatInfo)
                      CultureInfo.CurrentCulture.NumberFormat.Clone();
A cloned format provider is always writable—even if the original was read-only.

# Composite formatting
Composite format strings allow you to combine variable substitution with format strings. The static string.Format method accepts a composite format string (we illustrated this in “String.Format and composite format strings”):

string composite = "Credit={0:C}";
Console.WriteLine (string.Format (composite, 500));   // Credit=$500.00
The Console class itself overloads its Write and WriteLine methods to accept composite format strings, allowing us to shorten this example slightly:

Console.WriteLine ("Credit={0:C}", 500);   // Credit=$500.00
You can also append a composite format string to a StringBuilder (via Append​For⁠mat), and to a TextWriter for I/O (see Chapter 15).

string.Format accepts an optional format provider. A simple application for this is to call ToString on an arbitrary object while passing in a format provider:

string s = string.Format (CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, "{0}", someObject);
This is equivalent to the following:

string s;
if (someObject is IFormattable)
  s = ((IFormattable)someObject).ToString (null,
                                           CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
else if (someObject == null)
  s = "";
else
  s = someObject.ToString();

# Parsing with format providers
There’s no standard interface for parsing through a format provider. Instead, each participating type overloads its static Parse (and TryParse) method to accept a format provider and, optionally, a NumberStyles or DateTimeStyles enum.

NumberStyles and DateTimeStyles control how parsing works: they let you specify such things as whether parentheses or a currency symbol can appear in the input string (by default, the answer to both questions is no). For example:
```c#
int error = int.Parse ("(2)");   // Exception thrown

int minusTwo = int.Parse ("(2)", NumberStyles.Integer |
                                 NumberStyles.AllowParentheses);   // OK

decimal fivePointTwo = decimal.Parse ("£5.20", NumberStyles.Currency,
                       CultureInfo.GetCultureInfo ("en-GB"));
```
`The NumberStyles.AllowParentheses flag` is a value of the NumberStyles enumeration in .NET that specifies whether to allow the input string to include parentheses to indicate negative values.

When this flag is used in conjunction with the NumberStyles.Integer flag, as in the example you provided, the int.Parse() method will recognize and correctly interpret negative numbers enclosed in parentheses. In the example, the input string "(2)" represents a negative number, which is parsed as -2 due to the presence of the parentheses and the use of the NumberStyles.AllowParentheses flag.

Without this flag, the int.Parse() method would not recognize the parentheses and would treat the input string as an invalid number, resulting in a FormatException
The next section lists all NumberStyles and DateTimeStyles members as well as the default parsing rules for each type.

# IFormatProvider and ICustomFormatter
All format providers implement IFormatProvider:

public interface IFormatProvider { object GetFormat (Type formatType); }
The purpose of this method is to provide indirection—this is what allows Culture​Info to defer to an appropriate NumberFormatInfo or DateTimeInfo object to do the work.

By implementing IFormatProvider—along with ICustomFormatter—you can also write your own format provider that works in conjunction with existing types. ICustomFormatter defines a single method, as follows:

string Format (string format, object arg, IFormatProvider formatProvider);
The following custom format provider writes numbers as words:

public class WordyFormatProvider : IFormatProvider, ICustomFormatter
{
  static readonly string[] _numberWords =
   "zero one two three four five six seven eight nine minus point".Split();

  IFormatProvider _parent;   // Allows consumers to chain format providers

  public WordyFormatProvider () : this (CultureInfo.CurrentCulture) { }
  public WordyFormatProvider (IFormatProvider parent) => _parent = parent;

  public object GetFormat (Type formatType)
  {
    if (formatType == typeof (ICustomFormatter)) return this;
    return null;
  }

  public string Format (string format, object arg, IFormatProvider prov)
  {
    // If it's not our format string, defer to the parent provider:
    if (arg == null || format != "W")
      return string.Format (_parent, "{0:" + format + "}", arg);

    StringBuilder result = new StringBuilder();
    string digitList = string.Format (CultureInfo.InvariantCulture,
                                      "{0}", arg);
    foreach (char digit in digitList)
    {
      int i = "0123456789-.".IndexOf (digit),
                                      StringComparison.InvariantCulture);
      if (i == -1) continue;
      if (result.Length > 0) result.Append (' ');
      result.Append (_numberWords[i]);
    }
    return result.ToString();
  }
}
Notice that in the Format method, we used string.Format—with Invariant​Cul⁠ture—to convert the input number to a string. It would have been simpler just to call ToString() on arg, but then CurrentCulture would have been used instead. The reason for needing the invariant culture is evident a few lines later:

int i = "0123456789-.".IndexOf (digit),
                                      StringComparison.InvariantCulture);
It’s critical here that the number string comprises only the characters 0123456789-. and not any internationalized versions of these.

Here’s an example of using WordyFormatProvider:

double n = -123.45;
IFormatProvider fp = new WordyFormatProvider();
Console.WriteLine (string.Format (fp, "{0:C} in words is {0:W}", n));

// -$123.45 in words is minus one two three point four five
You can use custom format providers only in composite format strings.

# Standard Format Strings and Parsing Flags
The standard format strings control how a numeric type or DateTime/DateTime​Off⁠set is converted to a string. There are two kinds of format strings:

`Standard format strings`: With these, you provide general guidance. A standard format string consists of a single letter, followed, optionally, by a digit (whose meaning depends on the letter). An example is "C" or "F2".
`Custom format strings`: With these, you micromanage every character with a template. An example is "0:#.000E+00".
Custom format strings are unrelated to custom format providers.

Integrals only.

`R` or G9/G17	Round-trip	1f / 3f, "R"	0.333333343	Use R for BigInteger, G17 for double, or G9 for float.
Supplying no numeric format string (or a null or blank string) is equivalent to using the "G" standard format string followed by no digit. This exhibits the following behavior:

Numbers smaller than 10−4 or larger than the type’s precision are expressed in exponential (scientific) notation.

The two decimal places at the limit of float or double’s precision are rounded away to mask the inaccuracies inherent in conversion to decimal from their underlying binary form.

` `
The automatic rounding just described is usually beneficial and goes unnoticed. However, it can cause trouble if you need to round-trip a number; in other words, convert it to a string and back again (maybe repeatedly) while preserving value equality. For this reason, the R, G17, and G9 format strings exist to circumvent this implicit rounding.

# NumberStyles
Each numeric type defines a static Parse method that accepts a NumberStyles argument. NumberStyles is a flags enum that lets you determine how the string is read as it’s converted to a numeric type. It has the following combinable members:

AllowLeadingWhite    AllowTrailingWhite
AllowLeadingSign     AllowTrailingSign
AllowParentheses     AllowDecimalPoint
AllowThousands       AllowExponent
AllowCurrencySymbol  AllowHexSpecifier

NumberStyles also defines these composite members:

None  Integer  Float  Number  HexNumber  Currency  Any

```c#
int thousand = int.Parse ("3E8", NumberStyles.HexNumber);
int minusTwo = int.Parse ("(2)", NumberStyles.Integer |
                                 NumberStyles.AllowParentheses);
double aMillion = double.Parse ("1,000,000", NumberStyles.Any);
decimal threeMillion = decimal.Parse ("3e6", NumberStyles.Any);
decimal fivePointTwo = decimal.Parse ("$5.20", NumberStyles.Currency);
```

# Date/Time Format Strings
Format strings for DateTime/DateTimeOffset can be divided into two groups based on whether they honor culture and format provider settings. Table 6-4 lists those that do; Table 6-5 lists those that don’t. The sample output comes from formatting the following DateTime (with invariant culture, in the case of Table 6-4):

new DateTime (2000, 1, 2,  17, 18, 19);

Table 6-4. Culture-sensitive date/time format strings
```
Format string	Meaning	Sample output
d	Short date	01/02/2000
D	Long date	Sunday, 02 January 2000
t	Short time	17:18
T	Long time	17:18:19
f	Long date + short time	Sunday, 02 January 2000 17:18
F	Long date + long time	Sunday, 02 January 2000 17:18:19
g	Short date + short time	01/02/2000 17:18
G (default)	Short date + long time	01/02/2000 17:18:19
m, M	Month and day	02 January
y, Y	Year and month	January 2000
o	Round-trippable	2000-01-02T17:18:19.0000000	Will append time zone information unless DateTimeKind is Unspecified.
r, R	RFC 1123 standard	Sun, 02 Jan 2000 17:18:19 GMT	You must explicitly convert to UTC with DateTime.ToUniversalTime.
s	Sortable; ISO 8601	2000-01-02T17:18:19	Compatible with text-based sorting.
u	“Universal” sortable	2000-01-02 17:18:19Z	Similar to above; must explicitly convert to UTC.
U	UTC	Sunday, 02 January 2000 17:18:19	Long date + short time, converted to UTC.
```

The format strings `"r", "R", and "u"` emit a suffix that implies UTC; yet they don’t automatically convert a local to a UTC DateTime (so you must do the conversion yourself). Ironically, `"U"` automatically converts to UTC but doesn’t write a time zone suffix! In fact, `"o"` is the only format specifier in the group that can write an unambiguous DateTime without intervention.

`DateTimeFormatInfo` also supports custom format strings: these are analogous to numeric custom format strings. The list is extensive and is available online in Microsoft’s documentation. Here’s an example of a custom format string:
```c#
yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss
```

# Parsing and misparsing DateTimes
Strings that put the month or day first are ambiguous and can easily be misparsed—particularly if you have global customers. This is not a problem in user interface controls, because the same settings are in force when parsing as when formatting. But when writing to a file, for instance, day/month misparsing can be a real problem. There are two solutions:

Always state the same explicit culture when formatting and parsing (e.g., invariant culture).

Format DateTime and DateTimeOffsets in a manner independent of culture.

The second approach is more robust—particularly if you choose a format that puts the four-digit year first: such strings are much more difficult to misparse by another party. Further, strings formatted with a standards-compliant year-first format (such as "o") can parse correctly alongside locally formatted strings—rather like a “universal donor.” (Dates formatted with "s" or "u" have the further benefit of being sortable.)

To illustrate, suppose that we generate a culture-insensitive DateTime string s as follows:

string s = DateTime.Now.ToString ("o");
NOTE
The "o" format string includes milliseconds in the output. The following custom format string gives the same result as "o" but without milliseconds:

yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss K
We can reparse this in two ways. ParseExact demands strict compliance with the specified format string:

DateTime dt1 = DateTime.ParseExact (s, "o", null);
(You can achieve a similar result with XmlConvert’s ToString and ToDateTime methods.)

Parse, however, implicitly accepts both the "o" format and the CurrentCulture format:

DateTime dt2 = DateTime.Parse (s);
This works with both DateTime and DateTimeOffset.

# DateTimeStyles
DateTimeStyles is a flags enum that provides additional instructions when calling Parse on a DateTime(Offset). Here are its members:

None,
AllowLeadingWhite, AllowTrailingWhite, AllowInnerWhite,
AssumeLocal, AssumeUniversal, AdjustToUniversal,
NoCurrentDateDefault, RoundTripKind
There is also a composite member, AllowWhiteSpaces:

AllowWhiteSpaces = AllowLeadingWhite | AllowTrailingWhite | AllowInnerWhite
The default is None. This means that extra whitespace is normally prohibited (whitespace that’s part of a standard DateTime pattern is exempt).

AssumeLocal and AssumeUniversal apply if the string doesn’t have a time zone suffix (such as Z or +9:00). AdjustToUniversal still honors time zone suffixes but then converts to UTC using the current regional settings.

If you parse a string comprising a time but no date, today’s date is applied by default. If you apply the NoCurrentDateDefault flag, however, it instead uses 1st January 0001.

# Enum Format Strings
In “Enums”, we described formatting and parsing enum values. Table 6-6 lists each format string and the result of applying it to the following expression:

Console.WriteLine (System.ConsoleColor.Red.ToString (formatString));
Table 6-6. Enum format strings
Format string	Meaning	Sample output	Notes
G or g	“General”	Red	Default
F or f	Treat as though Flags attribute were present	Red	Works on combined members even if enum has no Flags attribute
D or d	Decimal value	12	Retrieves underlying integral value
X or x	Hexadecimal value	0000000C	Retrieves underlying integral value

# Other Conversion Mechanisms
In the previous two sections, we covered format providers—.NET’s primary mechanism for formatting and parsing. Other important conversion mechanisms are scattered through various types and namespaces. Some convert to and from string, and some do other kinds of conversions. In this section, we discuss the following topics:

The Convert class and its functions:

Real to integral conversions that round rather than truncate

Parsing numbers in base 2, 8, and 16

Dynamic conversions

Base-64 translations

XmlConvert and its role in formatting and parsing for XML

Type converters and their role in formatting and parsing for designers and XAML

BitConverter, for binary conversions

# Convert
.NET calls the following types base types:

bool, char, string, System.DateTime, and System.DateTimeOffset

All the C# numeric types

The static Convert class defines methods for converting every base type to every other base type. Unfortunately, most of these methods are useless: either they throw exceptions or they are redundant alongside implicit casts. Among the clutter, however, are some useful methods, listed in the following sections.

# Rounding real to integral conversions
In Chapter 2, we saw how implicit and explicit casts allow you to convert between numeric types. In summary:
  - `Implicit casts work for nonlossy conversions (e.g., int to double).`
  - `Explicit casts are required for lossy conversions (e.g., double to int).`

Casts are optimized for efficiency; hence, they truncate data that won’t fit. This can be a problem when converting from a real number to an integer, because often you want to round rather than truncate. Convert’s numerical conversion methods address just this issue—they always round:
```c#
double d = 3.9;
int i = Convert.ToInt32 (d);    // i == 4
```
Convert uses banker’s rounding, which snaps midpoint values to even integers (this prevents positive or negative bias). If banker’s rounding is a problem, first call Math.Round on the real number: this accepts an additional argument that allows you to control midpoint rounding.
# Parsing numbers in base 2, 8, and 16
Hidden among the To(integral-type) methods are overloads that parse numbers in another base:

int thirty = Convert.ToInt32  ("1E", 16);    // Parse in hexadecimal
uint five  = Convert.ToUInt32 ("101", 2);    // Parse in binary
The second argument specifies the base. It can be any base you like—as long as it’s 2, 8, 10, or 16!

# Dynamic conversions
Occasionally, you need to convert from one type to another, but you don’t know what the types are until runtime. For this, the Convert class provides a ChangeType method:

public static object ChangeType (object value, Type conversionType);
The source and target types must be one of the “base” types. ChangeType also accepts an optional IFormatProvider argument. Here’s an example:
```c#
Type targetType = typeof (int);
object source = "42";

object result = Convert.ChangeType (source, targetType);

Console.WriteLine (result);             // 42
Console.WriteLine (result.GetType());   // System.Int32
```
An example of when this might be useful is in writing a deserializer that can work with multiple types. It can also convert any enum to its integral type (see “Enums”).

A limitation of ChangeType is that you cannot specify a format string or parsing flag.
# Base-64 conversions
Sometimes, you need to include binary data such as a bitmap within a text document, such as an XML file or email message. Base 64 is a ubiquitous means of encoding binary data as readable characters, using 64 characters from the ASCII set.

Convert’s ToBase64String method converts from a byte array to base 64; FromBase64String does the reverse.
# XmlConvert
If you’re dealing with data that’s originated from or destined for an XML file, XmlConvert (in the System.Xml namespace) provides the most suitable methods for formatting and parsing. The methods in XmlConvert handle the nuances of XML formatting without needing special format strings. For instance, true in XML is “true” and not “True.” The .NET BCL internally uses XmlConvert extensively. XmlConvert is also good for general-purpose culture-independent serialization.

The formatting methods in XmlConvert are all provided as overloaded ToString methods; the parsing methods are called ToBoolean, ToDateTime, and so on:

string s = XmlConvert.ToString (true);         // s = "true"
bool isTrue = XmlConvert.ToBoolean (s);
The methods that convert to and from DateTime accept an XmlDateTimeSerializationMode argument. This is an enum with the following values:

Unspecified, Local, Utc, RoundtripKind
Local and Utc cause a conversion to take place when formatting (if the DateTime is not already in that time zone). The time zone is then appended to the string:

2010-02-22T14:08:30.9375           // Unspecified
2010-02-22T14:07:30.9375+09:00     // Local
2010-02-22T05:08:30.9375Z          // Utc

Unspecified strips away any time-zone information embedded in the DateTime (i.e., DateTimeKind) before formatting. RoundtripKind honors the DateTime’s DateTimeKind—so when it’s reparsed, the resultant DateTime struct will be exactly as it was originally.

# Type Converters
Type converters are designed to format and parse in design-time environments. They also parse values in Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML) documents—as used in Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF).

In .NET, there are more than 100 type converters—covering such things as colors, images, and URIs. In contrast, format providers are implemented for only a handful of simple value types.

Type converters typically parse strings in a variety of ways—without needing hints. For instance, in a WPF application in Visual Studio, if you assign a control a background color by typing "Beige" into the appropriate property window, Color’s type converter figures out that you’re referring to a color name and not an RGB string or system color. This flexibility can sometimes make type converters useful in contexts outside of designers and XAML documents.

All type converters subclass TypeConverter in System.ComponentModel. To obtain a TypeConverter, call TypeDescriptor.GetConverter. The following obtains a TypeConverter for the Color type (in the System.Drawing namespace):

TypeConverter cc = TypeDescriptor.GetConverter (typeof (Color));
Among many other methods, TypeConverter defines methods to ConvertToString and ConvertFromString. We can call these as follows:

Color beige  = (Color) cc.ConvertFromString ("Beige");
Color purple = (Color) cc.ConvertFromString ("#800080");
Color window = (Color) cc.ConvertFromString ("Window");
By convention, type converters have names ending in Converter and are usually in the same namespace as the type they’re converting. A type links to its converter via a TypeConverterAttribute, allowing designers to pick up converters automatically.

Type converters can also provide design-time services such as generating standard value lists for populating a drop-down list in a designer or assisting with code serialization.

# BitConverter
Most base types can be converted to a byte array, by calling BitConverter.GetBytes:

foreach (byte b in BitConverter.GetBytes (3.5))
  Console.Write (b + " ");                          // 0 0 0 0 0 0 12 64
BitConverter also provides methods, such as ToDouble, for converting in the other direction.

The decimal and DateTime(Offset) types are not supported by BitConverter. You can, however, convert a decimal to an int array by calling decimal.GetBits. To go the other way around, decimal provides a constructor that accepts an int array.

In the case of DateTime, you can call ToBinary on an instance—this returns a long (upon which you can then use BitConverter). The static DateTime.FromBinary method does the reverse.
