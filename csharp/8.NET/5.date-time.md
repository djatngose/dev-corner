# Dates and Times
The following immutable structs in the System namespace do the job of representing dates and times: DateTime, DateTimeOffset, TimeSpan, DateOnly, and TimeOnly. C# doesn’t define any special keywords that map to these types.

# TimeSpan
A TimeSpan represents an interval of time—or a time of the day. In the latter role, it’s simply the “clock” time (without the date), which is equivalent to the time since midnight, assuming no daylight saving transition. A TimeSpan has a resolution of 100 ns, has a maximum value of about 10 million days, and can be positive or negative.

There are three ways to construct a TimeSpan:
  - Through one of the constructors
  - By calling one of the static From… methods
  - By subtracting one DateTime from another
```c#
public TimeSpan (int hours, int minutes, int seconds);
public TimeSpan (int days, int hours, int minutes, int seconds);
public TimeSpan (int days, int hours, int minutes, int seconds,
                                                   int milliseconds);
public TimeSpan (long ticks);   // Each tick = 100ns
```
Note: what is  resolution of 100 ns ~ each tick?
The resolution of 100 ns refers to a time measurement accuracy of 100 nanoseconds. It means that a timer or clock can measure and distinguish time intervals as small as 100 nanoseconds. This level of resolution is often used in computer systems and programming languages for various purposes such as measuring the execution time of code, scheduling tasks, or generating timestamps for events.


The static From… methods are more convenient when you want to specify an interval in just a single unit, such as minutes, hours, and so on:
```c#
public static TimeSpan FromDays (double value);
public static TimeSpan FromHours (double value);
public static TimeSpan FromMinutes (double value);
public static TimeSpan FromSeconds (double value);
public static TimeSpan FromMilliseconds (double value);
For example:

Console.WriteLine (new TimeSpan (2, 30, 0));     // 02:30:00
Console.WriteLine (TimeSpan.FromHours (2.5));    // 02:30:00
Console.WriteLine (TimeSpan.FromHours (-2.5));   // -02:30:00
```
TimeSpan overloads the < and > operators as well as the + and - operators. The following expression evaluates to a TimeSpan of 2.5 hours:

```c#
TimeSpan.FromHours(2) + TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30);
```

The next expression evaluates to one second short of 10 days:
```c#
TimeSpan.FromDays(10) - TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1);   // 9.23:59:59
```

Using this expression, we can illustrate the integer properties Days, Hours, Minutes, Seconds, and Milliseconds:
```c#
TimeSpan nearlyTenDays = TimeSpan.FromDays(10) - TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1);

Console.WriteLine (nearlyTenDays.Days);          // 9
Console.WriteLine (nearlyTenDays.Hours);         // 23
Console.WriteLine (nearlyTenDays.Minutes);       // 59
Console.WriteLine (nearlyTenDays.Seconds);       // 59
Console.WriteLine (nearlyTenDays.Milliseconds);  // 0 
```
In contrast, the Total... properties return values of type double describing the entire time span:

```c#
Console.WriteLine (nearlyTenDays.TotalDays);          // 9.99998842592593
Console.WriteLine (nearlyTenDays.TotalHours);         // 239.999722222222
Console.WriteLine (nearlyTenDays.TotalMinutes);       // 14399.9833333333
Console.WriteLine (nearlyTenDays.TotalSeconds);       // 863999
Console.WriteLine (nearlyTenDays.TotalMilliseconds);  // 863999000
```
The static Parse method does the opposite of ToString, converting a string to a TimeSpan. TryParse does the same but returns false rather than throwing an exception if the conversion fails. The XmlConvert class also provides TimeSpan/string conversion methods that follow standard XML formatting protocols.

The default value for a TimeSpan is TimeSpan.Zero.

TimeSpan can also be used to represent the time of the day (the elapsed time since midnight). To obtain the current time of day, call DateTime.Now.TimeOfDay.

# DateTime and DateTimeOffset
`DateTime` and `DateTimeOffset` are immutable structs for representing a date and, optionally, a time. They have a resolution of 100 ns and a range covering the years 0001 through 9999.

`DateTimeOffset` is functionally similar to DateTime. Its distinguishing feature is that it also stores a Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) offset; this allows more meaningful results when comparing values across different time zones. This makes DateTimeOffset more useful for representing date and time values across different time zones.
```c#
// Create a DateTime value representing midnight on January 1, 2022
DateTime dt = new DateTime(2022, 1, 1);

// Create a DateTimeOffset value representing the same date and time, but with an offset of -5 hours
DateTimeOffset dto = new DateTimeOffset(dt, TimeSpan.FromHours(-5));

// Display the values
Console.WriteLine($"DateTime value: {dt}");
Console.WriteLine($"DateTimeOffset value: {dto}");
```
The output of this code would be:

```c#
DateTime value: 1/1/2022 12:00:00 AM
DateTimeOffset value: 1/1/2022 12:00:00 AM -05:00
```
## Choosing between DateTime and DateTimeOffset
DateTime and DateTimeOffset differ in how they handle time zones. A DateTime incorporates a three-state flag indicating whether the DateTime is relative to the following:
  - The local time on the current computer
  - UTC (the modern equivalent of Greenwich Mean Time)
  - Unspecified

A DateTimeOffset is more specific—it stores the offset from UTC as a TimeSpan:
```c#
July 01 2019 03:00:00 -06:00
```

This influences equality comparisons, which is the main factor in choosing between DateTime and DateTimeOffset. Specifically:
  - `DateTime ignores the three-state flag in comparisons and considers two values equal if they have the same year, month, day, hour, minute, and so on.`
  - `DateTimeOffset considers two values equal if they refer to the same point in time.`

NOTE
Daylight Saving Time can make this distinction important even if your application doesn’t need to handle multiple geographic time zones.

So, DateTime considers the following two values different, whereas DateTimeOffset considers them equal:
```c#
July 01 2019 09:00:00 +00:00 (GMT)
July 01 2019 03:00:00 -06:00 (local time, Central America)
```

## In most cases, DateTimeOffset’s equality logic is preferable.
For example, in calculating which of two international events is more recent, a DateTimeOffset implicitly gives the correct answer. Similarly, a hacker plotting a Distributed Denial of Service attack would reach for a DateTimeOffset! To do the same with DateTime requires standardizing on a single time zone (typically UTC) throughout your application. This is problematic for two reasons:

  - To be friendly to the end user, UTC DateTimes require explicit conversion to local time prior to formatting.
  - It’s easy to forget and incorporate a local DateTime.

DateTimeOffset's equality logic is generally preferable over DateTime because it considers the offset in addition to the date and time. This is particularly important when dealing with times that cross over daylight saving time boundaries or when working with times that are in different time zones.

For example, if you have two DateTime values that represent the same moment in time but are in different time zones, their equality will not be the same because their offsets will be different. On the other hand, two DateTimeOffset values that represent the same moment in time but have different offsets will still be considered equal.

Therefore, when dealing with date and time values in which the offset is important, it's generally better to use DateTimeOffset over DateTime.

## DateTime is better, though, at specifying a value relative to the local computer at runtime
for example, if you want to schedule an archive at each of your international offices for next Sunday, at 3 A.M. local time (when there’s the least amount of activity). Here, DateTime would be more suitable because it would respect each site’s local time.
DateTime is better at specifying a value relative to the local computer at runtime because it uses the local system's time zone settings by default, whereas DateTimeOffset includes an offset from UTC, but doesn't necessarily indicate the local time zone.

This means that if you need to store or communicate an absolute point in time with a fixed offset from UTC, or if you're working with data that must be time-zone-agnostic,` DateTimeOffset is the better choice. However, if you're dealing with local time, or if you need to make calculations based on the time zone of the local computer, DateTime is more appropriate.`

## When to use Datetime over DateTimeOffset
`Storing dates and times in a database`: Some databases do not support DateTimeOffset natively, or require additional configuration to use it. In such cases, DateTime may be the simpler choice.
`Working with legacy code`: If you are working with code that was written before DateTimeOffset was introduced in .NET Framework 3.5, it may be easier to use DateTime to maintain compatibility.
`Interacting with APIs that use DateTime`: Some APIs, such as the .NET Framework itself, may use DateTime instead of DateTimeOffset. In such cases, using DateTime can help maintain consistency across different parts of your codebase.
`Representing time zones`: DateTime does not include any information about time zones, so it may be more appropriate to use DateTimeOffset when dealing with time zone-aware scenarios. However, if you only need to represent dates and times in a local context, DateTime may be sufficient.

# When to use DateTimeOffset over Datetime
`Storing and comparing timestamps across different time zones`: If you need to store and compare timestamps across different time zones, DateTimeOffset is the preferred choice as it includes both the local date and time and the time zone offset.

`Handling daylight saving time changes`: DateTimeOffset is useful when handling daylight saving time changes, as it automatically adjusts for the change in the time zone offset.

`Working with web applications: `When working with web applications that use client time zones, DateTimeOffset can help ensure consistent and accurate timestamps by including the offset information.

`Logging events:` In scenarios where accurate and precise timestamping is important, such as in logging events, DateTimeOffset can provide a more accurate representation of the time the event occurred, regardless of the local time zone.

`Scheduling tasks: `When scheduling tasks that need to occur at specific times, DateTimeOffset can help ensure the correct time is used regardless of the local time zone or any daylight saving time changes.

# Constructing a DateTime
DateTime defines constructors that accept integers for the year, month, and day—and, optionally, the hour, minute, second, and millisecond:
```c#
public DateTime (int year, int month, int day);

public DateTime (int year, int month, int day,
                 int hour, int minute, int second, int millisecond);
```
If you specify only a date, the time is implicitly set to midnight (0:00).

The DateTime constructors also allow you to specify a `DateTimeKind—an` enum with the following values:
```c#
Unspecified, Local, Utc
```
This corresponds to the three-state flag described in the preceding section. `Unspecified is the default`, and it means that the DateTime is time-zone-agnostic. `Local` means relative to the local time zone on the current computer. A local DateTime does not include information about which particular time zone it refers to, or, unlike `DateTimeOffset`, the numeric offset from UTC.

Example 1:
```c#
DateTime dateTime = new DateTime(2022, 3, 1, 10, 0, 0, DateTimeKind.Utc);
Console.WriteLine(dateTime); // Output: 3/1/2022 10:00:00 AM
Console.WriteLine(dateTime.ToLocalTime()); // Output: 3/1/2022 2:00:00 AM
```
In this example, the DateTime is explicitly marked as Utc, which means it represents a specific point in time relative to Coordinated Universal Time. When ToLocalTime() is called, the method will adjust the DateTime value to the local time zone. The output of ToLocalTime() reflects this adjustment, resulting in a four-hour difference from the original DateTime value.
Example 2:
```c#
DateTime dateTime = new DateTime(2022, 3, 1, 10, 0, 0, DateTimeKind.Local);
Console.WriteLine(dateTime); // Output: 3/1/2022 10:00:00 AM
Console.WriteLine(dateTime.ToUniversalTime()); // Output: 3/1/2022 3:00:00 PM
```
In this example, the DateTime is explicitly marked as Local, which means it represents a local time zone without any specific reference to a time standard such as UTC. When ToUniversalTime() is called, the method will adjust the DateTime value to UTC. The output of ToUniversalTime() reflects this adjustment, resulting in a five-hour difference from the original DateTime value.
Example 3:
```c#
DateTime unspecifiedDateTime = new DateTime(2023, 3, 1, 10, 0, 0, DateTimeKind.Unspecified);

Console.WriteLine(unspecifiedDateTime); // 3/1/2023 10:00:00 AM

Console.WriteLine(unspecifiedDateTime.ToLocalTime()); // 3/1/2023 10:00:00 AM (if the local time zone is UTC-8)
Console.WriteLine(unspecifiedDateTime.ToUniversalTime()); // 3/1/2023 6:00:00 PM
```
When the DateTimeKind is `Unspecified`, it means that the time is not explicitly defined with respect to a specific time zone. In this case, the DateTime object will use the time zone of the computer it is running on to interpret the date and time values. This can lead to different interpretations of the same date and time values, depending on the time zone of the computer.

`You can also construct a DateTime with a single ticks value of type long, where ticks is the number of 100 ns intervals from midnight 01/01/0001.`

For interoperability, DateTime provides the static FromFileTime and FromFile​Ti⁠meUtc methods for converting from a Windows file time (specified as a long) and FromOADate for converting from an OLE automation date/time (specified as a double).

# Constructing a DateTimeOffset
DateTimeOffset has a similar set of constructors. The difference is that you also specify a UTC offset as a TimeSpan:

public DateTimeOffset (int year, int month, int day,
                       int hour, int minute, int second,
                       TimeSpan offset);

public DateTimeOffset (int year, int month, int day,
                       int hour, int minute, int second, int millisecond,
                       TimeSpan offset);
The TimeSpan must amount to a whole number of minutes; otherwise an exception is thrown.

DateTimeOffset also has constructors that accept a Calendar object, a long ticks value, and static Parse and ParseExact methods that accept a string.

You can construct a DateTimeOffset from an existing DateTime either by using these constructors:
```c#
public DateTimeOffset (DateTime dateTime);
public DateTimeOffset (DateTime dateTime, TimeSpan offset);
or with an implicit cast:

DateTimeOffset dt = new DateTime (2000, 2, 3);
```
Note: The implicit cast from DateTime to DateTimeOffset is handy because most of the .NET BCL supports DateTime—not DateTimeOffset.

`If you don’t specify an offset, it’s inferred from the DateTime value using these rules:`
  - If the DateTime has a DateTimeKind of Utc, the offset is zero.
  - If the DateTime has a DateTimeKind of Local or Unspecified (the default), the offset is taken from the current local time zone.
To convert in the other direction, `DateTimeOffset` provides three properties that return values of type DateTime:
  - The `UtcDateTime` property returns a DateTime in UTC time.
  - The `LocalDateTime` property returns a DateTime in the current local time zone (converting it if necessary).
  - The `DateTime` property returns a DateTime in whatever zone it was specified, with a Kind of Unspecified (i.e., it returns the UTC time plus the offset).

# The current DateTime/DateTimeOffset
Both `DateTime and DateTimeOffset` have a static `Now` property that returns the current date and time:
```c#
Console.WriteLine (DateTime.Now);         // 11/11/2019 1:23:45 PM
Console.WriteLine (DateTimeOffset.Now);   // 11/11/2019 1:23:45 PM -06:00
```
DateTime also provides a `Today` property that returns just the date portion:
```c#
Console.WriteLine (DateTime.Today);       // 11/11/2019 12:00:00 AM
```
The static UtcNow property returns the current date and time in UTC:
```c#
Console.WriteLine (DateTime.UtcNow);        // 11/11/2019 7:23:45 AM
Console.WriteLine (DateTimeOffset.UtcNow);  // 11/11/2019 7:23:45 AM +00:00
```
The precision of all these methods depends on the operating system and is typically in the 10 to 20 ms region.

# Working with dates and times
DateTime and DateTimeOffset provide a similar set of instance properties that return various date/time elements:

```c#
DateTime dt = new DateTime (2000, 2, 3,
                            10, 20, 30);

Console.WriteLine (dt.Year);         // 2000
Console.WriteLine (dt.Month);        // 2
Console.WriteLine (dt.Day);          // 3
Console.WriteLine (dt.DayOfWeek);    // Thursday
Console.WriteLine (dt.DayOfYear);    // 34

Console.WriteLine (dt.Hour);         // 10
Console.WriteLine (dt.Minute);       // 20
Console.WriteLine (dt.Second);       // 30
Console.WriteLine (dt.Millisecond);  // 0
Console.WriteLine (dt.Ticks);        // 630851700300000000
Console.WriteLine (dt.TimeOfDay);    // 10:20:30  (returns a TimeSpan)
```
`DateTimeOffset also has an Offset property of type TimeSpan.`
```c#
DateTimeOffset dt = new DateTimeOffset (2000, 2, 3,
    10, 20, 30, TimeSpan.FromHours(2));
var offset = dt.Offset;
```
Both types provide the following instance methods to perform computations (most accept an argument of type double or int):
```c#
AddYears  AddMonths   AddDays
AddHours  AddMinutes  AddSeconds  AddMilliseconds  AddTicks
```
These all return a new DateTime or DateTimeOffset, and they take into account such things as leap years. You can pass in a negative value to subtract.

The Add method adds a TimeSpan to a DateTime or DateTimeOffset. The + operator is overloaded to do the same job:
```c#
TimeSpan ts = TimeSpan.FromMinutes (90);
Console.WriteLine (dt.Add (ts));
Console.WriteLine (dt + ts);             // same as above
```
You can also subtract a TimeSpan from a DateTime/DateTimeOffset and subtract one DateTime/DateTimeOffset from another. The latter gives you a TimeSpan:
```c#
DateTime thisYear = new DateTime (2015, 1, 1);
DateTime nextYear = thisYear.AddYears (1);
TimeSpan oneYear = nextYear - thisYear;
```
# Formatting and parsing DateTimes
Calling `ToString on a DateTime` formats the result as a short date (all numbers) followed by a long time (including seconds). For example:
```c#
11/11/2019 11:50:30 AM
```
The operating system’s control panel, by default, determines such things as whether the day, month, or year comes first; the use of leading zeros; and whether 12- or 24-hour time is used.

Calling `ToString on a DateTimeOffset` is the same, except that the offset is also returned:
```c#
11/11/2019 11:50:30 AM -06:00
```
The `ToShortDateString` and `ToLongDateString` methods return just the date portion. The long date format is also determined by the control panel; an example is `Wednesday, 11 November 2015.` 
`ToShortTimeString and ToLongTimeString` return just the time portion, such as `17:10:10 (the former excludes seconds)`.

`WARNING`
`DateTimes and DateTimeOffsets` can be misparsed if the culture settings differ from those in force when formatting takes place. You can avoid this problem by using ToString in conjunction with a format string that ignores culture settings (such as `o`):
```c#
DateTime dt1 = DateTime.Now;
string cannotBeMisparsed = dt1.ToString ("o");
DateTime dt2 = DateTime.Parse (cannotBeMisparsed);
```
The static `Parse/TryParse and ParseExact/TryParseExact` methods do the reverse of ToString, converting a string to a DateTime or DateTimeOffset. These methods are also overloaded to accept a format provider. The Try* methods return false instead of throwing a FormatException.
# To avoid the misparsing of DateTime and DateTimeOffset, it is recommended to always use a consistent culture when formatting and parsing date and time values.
Use the `CultureInfo.InvariantCulture` to ensure consistent formatting and parsing across different cultures.
```c#
DateTime dt = DateTime.ParseExact("2022-03-01T12:30:00Z", "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ss'Z'", CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);

```
Specify the `culture explicitly` when formatting and parsing date and time values.
```c#
DateTime dt = DateTime.ParseExact("01/03/2022 12:30:00 PM", "dd/MM/yyyy hh:mm:ss tt", new CultureInfo("en-US"));
```
Use the `DateTimeStyles` parameter to specify the format and culture for parsing date and time values.
```c#
DateTime dt = DateTime.ParseExact("01/03/2022 12:30:00 PM", "dd/MM/yyyy hh:mm:ss tt", CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, DateTimeStyles.AssumeUniversal);
```
By using these techniques, you can ensure that DateTime and DateTimeOffset values are parsed correctly, regardless of the culture settings in use.

# When you have a DateTime format string in US and another in UK, , how to convert it to a same date time format string?
When you have a DateTime format string in US and another in UK, you can convert it to a single standard format string by using the DateTime.ParseExact or DateTimeOffset.ParseExact methods with the appropriate format string and culture.

For example, if you have a DateTime string in US format ("MM/dd/yyyy") and a DateTime string in UK format ("dd/MM/yyyy"), you can convert both to a `standard ISO 8601 format ("yyyy-MM-ddTHH:mm:ss.fffffffzzz")` using the following code:

```c#
// US format string
string usDateTimeString = "12/31/2021 12:00:00 AM";

// UK format string
string ukDateTimeString = "31/12/2021 12:00:00 AM";

// Convert US DateTime string to standard format
DateTime usDateTime = DateTime.ParseExact(usDateTimeString, "MM/dd/yyyy h:mm:ss tt", CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
string standardDateTimeString = usDateTime.ToString("o");

// Convert UK DateTime string to standard format
DateTime ukDateTime = DateTime.ParseExact(ukDateTimeString, "dd/MM/yyyy h:mm:ss tt", CultureInfo.InvariantCulture);
string standardDateTimeString2 = ukDateTime.ToString("o");

```
In the above code, the DateTime.ParseExact method is used to parse the US and UK DateTime strings using the appropriate format string and the CultureInfo.InvariantCulture. Then the ToString method is used with the "o" format specifier to convert the DateTime objects to the standard ISO 8601 format.

Another way to handle this scenario is to use the DateTimeOffset struct with a specific culture when parsing the string. Here's an example:

```c#
string dateStringUS = "10/20/2022 09:30:00 AM";
string dateStringUK = "20/10/2022 09:30:00";
CultureInfo ukCulture = new CultureInfo("en-GB");

DateTimeOffset dateTimeOffsetUS = DateTime.Parse(dateStringUS, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, DateTimeStyles.AssumeLocal).ToUniversalTime();
DateTimeOffset dateTimeOffsetUK = DateTimeOffset.ParseExact(dateStringUK, "dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm:ss", ukCulture, DateTimeStyles.AssumeLocal);

Console.WriteLine(dateTimeOffsetUS.ToString("u"));
Console.WriteLine(dateTimeOffsetUK.ToString("u"));
```
In this example, we're using DateTime.Parse with DateTimeStyles.AssumeLocal to parse the US date string into a DateTimeOffset object, and then converting it to UTC using the ToUniversalTime method. For the UK date string, we're using DateTimeOffset.ParseExact with the "dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm:ss" format string and the UK culture to parse it directly into a DateTimeOffset object.

Both DateTimeOffset objects are then printed using the "u" format string to ensure they're in ISO 8601 format. This approach ensures that the date strings are correctly parsed into the same date and time values, regardless of the original culture format.
```c#

string dateStringUS = "10/20/2022 09:30:00 AM";
string dateStringUK = "20/10/2022 09:30:00";
CultureInfo ukCulture = new CultureInfo("en-GB");

DateTimeOffset dateTimeOffsetUS = DateTime.Parse(dateStringUS, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, DateTimeStyles.AssumeLocal).ToUniversalTime();
DateTimeOffset dateTimeOffsetUK = DateTimeOffset.ParseExact(dateStringUK, "dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm:ss", ukCulture, DateTimeStyles.AssumeLocal);

Console.WriteLine(dateTimeOffsetUS.ToString("u"));
Console.WriteLine(dateTimeOffsetUK.ToString("u"));
// 2022-10-20 02:30:00Z
// 2022-10-20 02:30:00Z

Console.WriteLine();

Console.WriteLine(DateTime.Now);
Console.WriteLine(DateTimeOffset.Now);
Console.WriteLine(DateTimeOffset.UtcNow);
Console.WriteLine(DateTime.UtcNow);
Console.WriteLine();
// 05/03/2023 08:51:09
// 05/03/2023 08:51:09 +07:00
// 05/03/2023 01:51:09 +00:00
// 05/03/2023 01:51:09



Console.WriteLine(DateTime.Now.ToString("O"));
Console.WriteLine(DateTimeOffset.Now.ToString("O"));
Console.WriteLine(DateTime.UtcNow.ToString("O"));
Console.WriteLine();
// 2023-03-04T22:11:18.9953820+07:00
// 2023-03-04T22:11:19.0268830+07:00
// 2023-03-04T15:11:19.0269000Z

DateTime dt1 = DateTime.Now;
Console.WriteLine(dt1);
string cannotBeMisparsed = dt1.ToString ("o");
DateTime dt2 = DateTime.Parse (cannotBeMisparsed,new CultureInfo("en-US"));
Console.WriteLine(dt2);
// 05/03/2023 09:05:41
// 05/03/2023 09:05:41


Console.WriteLine();

Console.WriteLine(DateTime.Now.ToString("s"));
Console.WriteLine(DateTimeOffset.Now.ToString("s"));
Console.WriteLine(DateTime.UtcNow.ToString("s"));
// 2023-03-04T22:08:45
// 2023-03-04T22:08:45
// 2023-03-04T15:08:45

Console.WriteLine();
Console.WriteLine(DateTime.Now.ToString("u"));
Console.WriteLine(DateTimeOffset.Now.ToString("u"));
Console.WriteLine(DateTime.UtcNow.ToString("u"));

// 2023-03-04 22:11:19Z
// 2023-03-04 15:11:19Z
// 2023-03-04 15:11:19Z


```

# what is iso 8601 standard format?

`ISO 8601 is` a standard format for representing date and time in a machine-readable format. It is widely used in computer systems and across the internet. The format uses a combination of numeric and character-based representations to convey date and time information.

`The basic format for a date` is `YYYY-MM-DD`, `where YYYY represents the four-digit year, MM represents the two-digit month, and DD represents the two-digit day`. For example, January 1, 2022 would be represented as 2022-01-01.

`The basic format for a time` is `HH:MM:SS`, where HH represents the two-digit hour (in 24-hour format), MM represents the two-digit minute, and SS represents the two-digit second. For example, 3:30 PM would be represented as 15:30:00.

In addition to these basic formats, ISO 8601 also allows for more complex date and time representations, such as including time zone information, using decimal fractions to represent seconds, and using intervals to represent spans of time.

Another way to handle this scenario is to use the DateTimeOffset struct with a specific culture when parsing the string. Here's an example:

```c#
string dateStringUS = "10/20/2022 09:30:00 AM";
string dateStringUK = "20/10/2022 09:30:00";
CultureInfo ukCulture = new CultureInfo("en-GB");

DateTimeOffset dateTimeOffsetUS = DateTime.Parse(dateStringUS, CultureInfo.InvariantCulture, DateTimeStyles.AssumeLocal).ToUniversalTime();
DateTimeOffset dateTimeOffsetUK = DateTimeOffset.ParseExact(dateStringUK, "dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm:ss", ukCulture, DateTimeStyles.AssumeLocal);

Console.WriteLine(dateTimeOffsetUS.ToString("u"));
Console.WriteLine(dateTimeOffsetUK.ToString("u"));
```
In this example, we're using DateTime.Parse with DateTimeStyles.AssumeLocal to parse the US date string into a DateTimeOffset object, and then converting it to UTC using the ToUniversalTime method. For the UK date string, we're using DateTimeOffset.ParseExact with the "dd/MM/yyyy HH:mm:ss" format string and the UK culture to parse it directly into a DateTimeOffset object.

Both DateTimeOffset objects are then printed using the "u" format string to ensure they're in ISO 8601 format. This approach ensures that the date strings are correctly parsed into the same date and time values, regardless of the original culture format.

# Null DateTime and DateTimeOffset values
Because DateTime and DateTimeOffset are structs, they are not intrinsically nullable. When you need nullability, there are two ways around this:

Use a Nullable type (i.e., DateTime? or DateTimeOffset?).

Use the static field DateTime.MinValue or DateTimeOffset.MinValue (the default values for these types).

A nullable type is usually the best approach because the compiler helps to prevent mistakes. DateTime.MinValue is useful for backward compatibility with code written prior to C# 2.0 (when nullable value types were introduced).

```c#
Console.WriteLine(DateTime.MinValue);
Console.WriteLine(DateTimeOffset.MinValue);
// 01/01/0001 00:00:00
// 01/01/0001 00:00:00 +00:00
```

`WARNING`:
`Calling ToUniversalTime or ToLocalTime on a DateTime.MinValue can result in it no longer being DateTime.MinValue `(depending on which side of GMT you are on). If you’re right on GMT (England, outside daylight saving), the problem won’t arise at all because local and UTC times are the same. This is your compensation for the English winter!


# COnvert Utc to local timezone with daylight saving time
If you have stored DateTime.UtcNow in the database, it's already in UTC and doesn't need to be adjusted for daylight saving time. However, if you want to display the stored datetime value in local time with the correct daylight saving time adjustment, you can convert it to the desired time zone using the TimeZoneInfo class.

Here's an example of how to convert a DateTime value stored in UTC to the Eastern Standard Time (EST) time zone with the correct daylight saving time adjustment:

```c#
DateTime utcTime = DateTime.UtcNow;
TimeZoneInfo estTimeZone = TimeZoneInfo.FindSystemTimeZoneById("Eastern Standard Time");
DateTime estTime = TimeZoneInfo.ConvertTimeFromUtc(utcTime, estTimeZone);
```
In this example, we first get the current UTC time using DateTime.UtcNow. Then we get a TimeZoneInfo object for the Eastern Standard Time (EST) time zone using TimeZoneInfo.FindSystemTimeZoneById. Finally, we convert the UTC time to the EST time zone using TimeZoneInfo.ConvertTimeFromUtc. The resulting DateTime value will be adjusted for daylight saving time if necessary.

# Does .net automatically handle the dayligh saving tiem with DateTime?
Yes, .NET framework automatically handles daylight saving time with DateTime. When you convert between local time and Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), or when you convert between two different time zones, the framework automatically adjusts the result for daylight saving time.

However, you should be careful when storing and manipulating local times that fall within the transition period during which daylight saving time starts or ends, as the behavior of some DateTime methods may be unpredictable during this period. It is recommended to use DateTimeOffset instead of DateTime when you need to handle such scenarios, as DateTimeOffset can represent a point in time unambiguously regardless of whether it is within a daylight saving transition period or not.

# An example write a schedule job using .net can automatically handle the daylight saving time
```c#
public class ScheduledJob
{
    private readonly TimeZoneInfo _timeZone;

    public ScheduledJob()
    {
        // Set the time zone for the job
        _timeZone = TimeZoneInfo.FindSystemTimeZoneById("Central Standard Time");
    }

    public void Run()
    {
        // Get the current date and time in the time zone of the job
        var now = TimeZoneInfo.ConvertTimeFromUtc(DateTime.UtcNow, _timeZone);

        // Do something based on the current date and time, like send an email or run a task
        // ...

        // Log the execution time in UTC and the time zone of the job
        var utcExecutionTime = TimeZoneInfo.ConvertTimeToUtc(now, _timeZone);
        Console.WriteLine($"Job executed at {utcExecutionTime:s} UTC ({_timeZone.Id})");
    }
}

```
In this example, we define a scheduled job that runs in the Central Standard Time zone. We use the TimeZoneInfo class to convert the current UTC date and time to the local time zone of the job. Then we perform some task based on the current date and time. Finally, we log the execution time in both UTC and the time zone of the job, using the ConvertTimeToUtc method to convert the local time back to UTC.

By using `TimeZoneInfo to handle time zones and daylight saving time`, our scheduled job will automatically adjust for any changes in the time zone, including daylight saving time transitions.

# what is a zero time (midnight)?
In the context of timekeeping, `"zero time" or "midnight" refers to the point in time when a day changes from one to another. It is typically represented as 12:00 am (12:00 hours after midnight) on a 12-hour clock or 00:00 (0 hours and 0 minutes) on a 24-hour clock`. It is a commonly used reference point for time-related calculations and scheduling.

# DateOnly and TimeOnly
The DateOnly and TimeOnly structs (from .NET 6) exist for when you only want to represent a date or time.

DateOnly is similar to DateTime, but without a time component. DateOnly also lacks DateTimeKind; in effect, it’s always Unspecified and has no concept of Local or Utc. The historical alternative to DateOnly was to use DateTime with a zero time (midnight). The difficulty with this approach is that equality comparisons fail when a non-zero time finds its way into your code.

TimeOnly is similar to DateTime, but without a date component. TimeOnly is intended for capturing the time of day and is suitable for applications such as recording alarm times or opening hours.
