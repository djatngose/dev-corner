# Dates and Times
The following immutable structs in the System namespace do the job of representing dates and times: DateTime, DateTimeOffset, TimeSpan, DateOnly, and TimeOnly. C# doesn’t define any special keywords that map to these types.

# TimeSpan
A TimeSpan represents an interval of time—or a time of the day. In the latter role, it’s simply the “clock” time (without the date), which is equivalent to the time since midnight, assuming no daylight saving transition. A TimeSpan has a resolution of 100 ns, has a maximum value of about 10 million days, and can be positive or negative.

There are three ways to construct a TimeSpan:
  - Through one of the constructors
  - By calling one of the static From… methods
  - By subtracting one DateTime from another
```c#
public TimeSpan (int hours, int minutes, int seconds);
public TimeSpan (int days, int hours, int minutes, int seconds);
public TimeSpan (int days, int hours, int minutes, int seconds,
                                                   int milliseconds);
public TimeSpan (long ticks);   // Each tick = 100ns
```
Note: what is  resolution of 100 ns ~ each tick?
The resolution of 100 ns refers to a time measurement accuracy of 100 nanoseconds. It means that a timer or clock can measure and distinguish time intervals as small as 100 nanoseconds. This level of resolution is often used in computer systems and programming languages for various purposes such as measuring the execution time of code, scheduling tasks, or generating timestamps for events.


The static From… methods are more convenient when you want to specify an interval in just a single unit, such as minutes, hours, and so on:
```c#
public static TimeSpan FromDays (double value);
public static TimeSpan FromHours (double value);
public static TimeSpan FromMinutes (double value);
public static TimeSpan FromSeconds (double value);
public static TimeSpan FromMilliseconds (double value);
For example:

Console.WriteLine (new TimeSpan (2, 30, 0));     // 02:30:00
Console.WriteLine (TimeSpan.FromHours (2.5));    // 02:30:00
Console.WriteLine (TimeSpan.FromHours (-2.5));   // -02:30:00
```
TimeSpan overloads the < and > operators as well as the + and - operators. The following expression evaluates to a TimeSpan of 2.5 hours:

```c#
TimeSpan.FromHours(2) + TimeSpan.FromMinutes(30);
```

The next expression evaluates to one second short of 10 days:
```c#
TimeSpan.FromDays(10) - TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1);   // 9.23:59:59
```

Using this expression, we can illustrate the integer properties Days, Hours, Minutes, Seconds, and Milliseconds:
```c#
TimeSpan nearlyTenDays = TimeSpan.FromDays(10) - TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1);

Console.WriteLine (nearlyTenDays.Days);          // 9
Console.WriteLine (nearlyTenDays.Hours);         // 23
Console.WriteLine (nearlyTenDays.Minutes);       // 59
Console.WriteLine (nearlyTenDays.Seconds);       // 59
Console.WriteLine (nearlyTenDays.Milliseconds);  // 0 
```
In contrast, the Total... properties return values of type double describing the entire time span:

```c#
Console.WriteLine (nearlyTenDays.TotalDays);          // 9.99998842592593
Console.WriteLine (nearlyTenDays.TotalHours);         // 239.999722222222
Console.WriteLine (nearlyTenDays.TotalMinutes);       // 14399.9833333333
Console.WriteLine (nearlyTenDays.TotalSeconds);       // 863999
Console.WriteLine (nearlyTenDays.TotalMilliseconds);  // 863999000
```
The static Parse method does the opposite of ToString, converting a string to a TimeSpan. TryParse does the same but returns false rather than throwing an exception if the conversion fails. The XmlConvert class also provides TimeSpan/string conversion methods that follow standard XML formatting protocols.

The default value for a TimeSpan is TimeSpan.Zero.

TimeSpan can also be used to represent the time of the day (the elapsed time since midnight). To obtain the current time of day, call DateTime.Now.TimeOfDay.

# DateTime and DateTimeOffset
`DateTime` and `DateTimeOffset` are immutable structs for representing a date and, optionally, a time. They have a resolution of 100 ns and a range covering the years 0001 through 9999.

`DateTimeOffset` is functionally similar to DateTime. Its distinguishing feature is that it also stores a Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) offset; this allows more meaningful results when comparing values across different time zones. This makes DateTimeOffset more useful for representing date and time values across different time zones.
```c#
// Create a DateTime value representing midnight on January 1, 2022
DateTime dt = new DateTime(2022, 1, 1);

// Create a DateTimeOffset value representing the same date and time, but with an offset of -5 hours
DateTimeOffset dto = new DateTimeOffset(dt, TimeSpan.FromHours(-5));

// Display the values
Console.WriteLine($"DateTime value: {dt}");
Console.WriteLine($"DateTimeOffset value: {dto}");
```
The output of this code would be:

```c#
DateTime value: 1/1/2022 12:00:00 AM
DateTimeOffset value: 1/1/2022 12:00:00 AM -05:00
```
## Choosing between DateTime and DateTimeOffset
DateTime and DateTimeOffset differ in how they handle time zones. A DateTime incorporates a three-state flag indicating whether the DateTime is relative to the following:
  - The local time on the current computer
  - UTC (the modern equivalent of Greenwich Mean Time)
  - Unspecified

A DateTimeOffset is more specific—it stores the offset from UTC as a TimeSpan:
```c#
July 01 2019 03:00:00 -06:00
```

This influences equality comparisons, which is the main factor in choosing between DateTime and DateTimeOffset. Specifically:
  - `DateTime ignores the three-state flag in comparisons and considers two values equal if they have the same year, month, day, hour, minute, and so on.`
  - `DateTimeOffset considers two values equal if they refer to the same point in time.`

NOTE
Daylight Saving Time can make this distinction important even if your application doesn’t need to handle multiple geographic time zones.

So, DateTime considers the following two values different, whereas DateTimeOffset considers them equal:
```c#
July 01 2019 09:00:00 +00:00 (GMT)
July 01 2019 03:00:00 -06:00 (local time, Central America)
```

## In most cases, DateTimeOffset’s equality logic is preferable.
For example, in calculating which of two international events is more recent, a DateTimeOffset implicitly gives the correct answer. Similarly, a hacker plotting a Distributed Denial of Service attack would reach for a DateTimeOffset! To do the same with DateTime requires standardizing on a single time zone (typically UTC) throughout your application. This is problematic for two reasons:

  - To be friendly to the end user, UTC DateTimes require explicit conversion to local time prior to formatting.
  - It’s easy to forget and incorporate a local DateTime.

DateTimeOffset's equality logic is generally preferable over DateTime because it considers the offset in addition to the date and time. This is particularly important when dealing with times that cross over daylight saving time boundaries or when working with times that are in different time zones.

For example, if you have two DateTime values that represent the same moment in time but are in different time zones, their equality will not be the same because their offsets will be different. On the other hand, two DateTimeOffset values that represent the same moment in time but have different offsets will still be considered equal.

Therefore, when dealing with date and time values in which the offset is important, it's generally better to use DateTimeOffset over DateTime.

## DateTime is better, though, at specifying a value relative to the local computer at runtime
for example, if you want to schedule an archive at each of your international offices for next Sunday, at 3 A.M. local time (when there’s the least amount of activity). Here, DateTime would be more suitable because it would respect each site’s local time.
DateTime is better at specifying a value relative to the local computer at runtime because it uses the local system's time zone settings by default, whereas DateTimeOffset includes an offset from UTC, but doesn't necessarily indicate the local time zone.

This means that if you need to store or communicate an absolute point in time with a fixed offset from UTC, or if you're working with data that must be time-zone-agnostic,` DateTimeOffset is the better choice. However, if you're dealing with local time, or if you need to make calculations based on the time zone of the local computer, DateTime is more appropriate.`

## When to use Datetime over DateTimeOffset
`Storing dates and times in a database`: Some databases do not support DateTimeOffset natively, or require additional configuration to use it. In such cases, DateTime may be the simpler choice.
`Working with legacy code`: If you are working with code that was written before DateTimeOffset was introduced in .NET Framework 3.5, it may be easier to use DateTime to maintain compatibility.
`Interacting with APIs that use DateTime`: Some APIs, such as the .NET Framework itself, may use DateTime instead of DateTimeOffset. In such cases, using DateTime can help maintain consistency across different parts of your codebase.
`Representing time zones`: DateTime does not include any information about time zones, so it may be more appropriate to use DateTimeOffset when dealing with time zone-aware scenarios. However, if you only need to represent dates and times in a local context, DateTime may be sufficient.

# When to use DateTimeOffset over Datetime
`Storing and comparing timestamps across different time zones`: If you need to store and compare timestamps across different time zones, DateTimeOffset is the preferred choice as it includes both the local date and time and the time zone offset.

`Handling daylight saving time changes`: DateTimeOffset is useful when handling daylight saving time changes, as it automatically adjusts for the change in the time zone offset.

`Working with web applications: `When working with web applications that use client time zones, DateTimeOffset can help ensure consistent and accurate timestamps by including the offset information.

`Logging events:` In scenarios where accurate and precise timestamping is important, such as in logging events, DateTimeOffset can provide a more accurate representation of the time the event occurred, regardless of the local time zone.

`Scheduling tasks: `When scheduling tasks that need to occur at specific times, DateTimeOffset can help ensure the correct time is used regardless of the local time zone or any daylight saving time changes.

# Constructing a DateTime
DateTime defines constructors that accept integers for the year, month, and day—and, optionally, the hour, minute, second, and millisecond:
```c#
public DateTime (int year, int month, int day);

public DateTime (int year, int month, int day,
                 int hour, int minute, int second, int millisecond);
```
If you specify only a date, the time is implicitly set to midnight (0:00).

The DateTime constructors also allow you to specify a `DateTimeKind—an` enum with the following values:
```c#
Unspecified, Local, Utc
```
This corresponds to the three-state flag described in the preceding section. `Unspecified is the default`, and it means that the DateTime is time-zone-agnostic. `Local` means relative to the local time zone on the current computer. A local DateTime does not include information about which particular time zone it refers to, or, unlike `DateTimeOffset`, the numeric offset from UTC.

Example 1:
```c#
DateTime dateTime = new DateTime(2022, 3, 1, 10, 0, 0, DateTimeKind.Utc);
Console.WriteLine(dateTime); // Output: 3/1/2022 10:00:00 AM
Console.WriteLine(dateTime.ToLocalTime()); // Output: 3/1/2022 2:00:00 AM
```
In this example, the DateTime is explicitly marked as Utc, which means it represents a specific point in time relative to Coordinated Universal Time. When ToLocalTime() is called, the method will adjust the DateTime value to the local time zone. The output of ToLocalTime() reflects this adjustment, resulting in a four-hour difference from the original DateTime value.
Example 2:
```c#
DateTime dateTime = new DateTime(2022, 3, 1, 10, 0, 0, DateTimeKind.Local);
Console.WriteLine(dateTime); // Output: 3/1/2022 10:00:00 AM
Console.WriteLine(dateTime.ToUniversalTime()); // Output: 3/1/2022 3:00:00 PM
```
In this example, the DateTime is explicitly marked as Local, which means it represents a local time zone without any specific reference to a time standard such as UTC. When ToUniversalTime() is called, the method will adjust the DateTime value to UTC. The output of ToUniversalTime() reflects this adjustment, resulting in a five-hour difference from the original DateTime value.
Example 3:
```c#
DateTime unspecifiedDateTime = new DateTime(2023, 3, 1, 10, 0, 0, DateTimeKind.Unspecified);

Console.WriteLine(unspecifiedDateTime); // 3/1/2023 10:00:00 AM

Console.WriteLine(unspecifiedDateTime.ToLocalTime()); // 3/1/2023 10:00:00 AM (if the local time zone is UTC-8)
Console.WriteLine(unspecifiedDateTime.ToUniversalTime()); // 3/1/2023 6:00:00 PM
```
When the DateTimeKind is `Unspecified`, it means that the time is not explicitly defined with respect to a specific time zone. In this case, the DateTime object will use the time zone of the computer it is running on to interpret the date and time values. This can lead to different interpretations of the same date and time values, depending on the time zone of the computer.

`You can also construct a DateTime with a single ticks value of type long, where ticks is the number of 100 ns intervals from midnight 01/01/0001.`

For interoperability, DateTime provides the static FromFileTime and FromFile​Ti⁠meUtc methods for converting from a Windows file time (specified as a long) and FromOADate for converting from an OLE automation date/time (specified as a double).

# Constructing a DateTimeOffset
DateTimeOffset has a similar set of constructors. The difference is that you also specify a UTC offset as a TimeSpan:

public DateTimeOffset (int year, int month, int day,
                       int hour, int minute, int second,
                       TimeSpan offset);

public DateTimeOffset (int year, int month, int day,
                       int hour, int minute, int second, int millisecond,
                       TimeSpan offset);
The TimeSpan must amount to a whole number of minutes; otherwise an exception is thrown.

DateTimeOffset also has constructors that accept a Calendar object, a long ticks value, and static Parse and ParseExact methods that accept a string.

You can construct a DateTimeOffset from an existing DateTime either by using these constructors:
```c#
public DateTimeOffset (DateTime dateTime);
public DateTimeOffset (DateTime dateTime, TimeSpan offset);
or with an implicit cast:

DateTimeOffset dt = new DateTime (2000, 2, 3);
```
Note: The implicit cast from DateTime to DateTimeOffset is handy because most of the .NET BCL supports DateTime—not DateTimeOffset.

`If you don’t specify an offset, it’s inferred from the DateTime value using these rules:`
  - If the DateTime has a DateTimeKind of Utc, the offset is zero.
  - If the DateTime has a DateTimeKind of Local or Unspecified (the default), the offset is taken from the current local time zone.
To convert in the other direction, `DateTimeOffset` provides three properties that return values of type DateTime:
  - The `UtcDateTime` property returns a DateTime in UTC time.
  - The `LocalDateTime` property returns a DateTime in the current local time zone (converting it if necessary).
  - The `DateTime` property returns a DateTime in whatever zone it was specified, with a Kind of Unspecified (i.e., it returns the UTC time plus the offset).

# The current DateTime/DateTimeOffset
Both `DateTime and DateTimeOffset` have a static `Now` property that returns the current date and time:
```c#
Console.WriteLine (DateTime.Now);         // 11/11/2019 1:23:45 PM
Console.WriteLine (DateTimeOffset.Now);   // 11/11/2019 1:23:45 PM -06:00
```
DateTime also provides a `Today` property that returns just the date portion:
```c#
Console.WriteLine (DateTime.Today);       // 11/11/2019 12:00:00 AM
```
The static UtcNow property returns the current date and time in UTC:
```c#
Console.WriteLine (DateTime.UtcNow);        // 11/11/2019 7:23:45 AM
Console.WriteLine (DateTimeOffset.UtcNow);  // 11/11/2019 7:23:45 AM +00:00
```
The precision of all these methods depends on the operating system and is typically in the 10 to 20 ms region.

# Working with dates and times
DateTime and DateTimeOffset provide a similar set of instance properties that return various date/time elements:

```c#
DateTime dt = new DateTime (2000, 2, 3,
                            10, 20, 30);

Console.WriteLine (dt.Year);         // 2000
Console.WriteLine (dt.Month);        // 2
Console.WriteLine (dt.Day);          // 3
Console.WriteLine (dt.DayOfWeek);    // Thursday
Console.WriteLine (dt.DayOfYear);    // 34

Console.WriteLine (dt.Hour);         // 10
Console.WriteLine (dt.Minute);       // 20
Console.WriteLine (dt.Second);       // 30
Console.WriteLine (dt.Millisecond);  // 0
Console.WriteLine (dt.Ticks);        // 630851700300000000
Console.WriteLine (dt.TimeOfDay);    // 10:20:30  (returns a TimeSpan)
```
`DateTimeOffset also has an Offset property of type TimeSpan.`
```c#
DateTimeOffset dt = new DateTimeOffset (2000, 2, 3,
    10, 20, 30, TimeSpan.FromHours(2));
var offset = dt.Offset;
```
Both types provide the following instance methods to perform computations (most accept an argument of type double or int):
```c#
AddYears  AddMonths   AddDays
AddHours  AddMinutes  AddSeconds  AddMilliseconds  AddTicks
```
These all return a new DateTime or DateTimeOffset, and they take into account such things as leap years. You can pass in a negative value to subtract.

The Add method adds a TimeSpan to a DateTime or DateTimeOffset. The + operator is overloaded to do the same job:
```c#
TimeSpan ts = TimeSpan.FromMinutes (90);
Console.WriteLine (dt.Add (ts));
Console.WriteLine (dt + ts);             // same as above
```
You can also subtract a TimeSpan from a DateTime/DateTimeOffset and subtract one DateTime/DateTimeOffset from another. The latter gives you a TimeSpan:
```c#
DateTime thisYear = new DateTime (2015, 1, 1);
DateTime nextYear = thisYear.AddYears (1);
TimeSpan oneYear = nextYear - thisYear;
```
