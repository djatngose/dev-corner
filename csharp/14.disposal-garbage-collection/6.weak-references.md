# Weak References
Occasionally, it’s useful to hold a reference to an object that’s “invisible” to the GC in terms of keeping the object alive. This is called a weak reference and is implemented by the System.WeakReference class.

To use WeakReference, construct it with a target object:

var sb = new StringBuilder ("this is a test");
var weak = new WeakReference (sb);
Console.WriteLine (weak.Target);     // This is a test
If a target is referenced only by one or more weak references, the GC will consider the target eligible for collection. When the target is collected, the Target property of the WeakReference will be null:

var weak = GetWeakRef();
GC.Collect();
Console.WriteLine (weak.Target);   // (nothing)

WeakReference GetWeakRef () => 
  new WeakReference (new StringBuilder ("weak"));
To prevent the target being collected in between testing for it being null and consuming it, assign the target to a local variable:

var sb = (StringBuilder) weak.Target;
if (sb != null) { /* Do something with sb */ }
After a target’s been assigned to a local variable, it has a strong root and so cannot be collected while that variable’s in use.

The following class uses weak references to keep track of all Widget objects that have been instantiated, without preventing those objects from being collected:

class Widget
{
  static List<WeakReference> _allWidgets = new List<WeakReference>();

  public readonly string Name;

  public Widget (string name)
  {
    Name = name;
    _allWidgets.Add (new WeakReference (this));
  }

  public static void ListAllWidgets()
  {
    foreach (WeakReference weak in _allWidgets)
    {
      Widget w = (Widget)weak.Target;
      if (w != null) Console.WriteLine (w.Name);
    }
  }
}
The only proviso with such a system is that the static list will grow over time, accumulating weak references with null targets. So, you need to implement some cleanup strategy.

# Weak References and Caching
One use for WeakReference is to cache large object graphs. This allows memory-intensive data to be cached briefly without causing excessive memory consumption:

_weakCache = new WeakReference (...);   // _weakCache is a field
...
var cache = _weakCache.Target;
if (cache == null) { /* Re-create cache & assign it to _weakCache */ }
This strategy can be only mildly effective in practice because you have little control over when the GC fires and what generation it chooses to collect. In particular, if your cache remains in Gen0, it can be collected within microseconds (and remember that the GC doesn’t collect only when memory is low—it collects regularly under normal memory conditions). So, at a minimum, you should employ a two-level cache whereby you start out by holding strong references that you convert to weak references over time.

# Weak References and Events
We saw earlier how events can cause managed memory leaks. The simplest solution is to either avoid subscribing in such conditions or implement a Dispose method to unsubscribe. Weak references offer another solution.

Imagine a delegate that holds only weak references to its targets. Such a delegate would not keep its targets alive—unless those targets had independent referees. Of course, this wouldn’t prevent a firing delegate from hitting an unreferenced target—in the time between the target being eligible for collection and the GC catching up with it. For such a solution to be effective, your code must be robust in that scenario. Assuming that is the case, you can implement a weak delegate class as follows:

public class WeakDelegate<TDelegate> where TDelegate : class
{
  class MethodTarget
  {
    public readonly WeakReference Reference;
    public readonly MethodInfo Method;

    public MethodTarget (Delegate d)
    {
      // d.Target will be null for static method targets:
      if (d.Target != null) Reference = new WeakReference (d.Target);
      Method = d.Method;
    }
  }

  List<MethodTarget> _targets = new List<MethodTarget>();

  public WeakDelegate()
  {
    if (!typeof (TDelegate).IsSubclassOf (typeof (Delegate)))
      throw new InvalidOperationException
        ("TDelegate must be a delegate type");
  }

  public void Combine (TDelegate target)
  {
    if (target == null) return;

    foreach (Delegate d in (target as Delegate).GetInvocationList())
      _targets.Add (new MethodTarget (d));
  }

  public void Remove (TDelegate target)
  {
    if (target == null) return;
    foreach (Delegate d in (target as Delegate).GetInvocationList())
    {
      MethodTarget mt = _targets.Find (w => 
        Equals (d.Target, w.Reference?.Target) &&
        Equals (d.Method.MethodHandle, w.Method.MethodHandle));

      if (mt != null) _targets.Remove (mt);
    }
  }

  public TDelegate Target
  {
    get
    {
      Delegate combinedTarget = null;

      foreach (MethodTarget mt in _targets.ToArray())
      {
        WeakReference wr = mt.Reference;

        // Static target || alive instance target
        if (wr == null || wr.Target != null)
        {
          var newDelegate = Delegate.CreateDelegate (
            typeof(TDelegate), wr?.Target, mt.Method);
            combinedTarget = Delegate.Combine (combinedTarget, newDelegate);
        }
        else
          _targets.Remove (mt);
      }

      return combinedTarget as TDelegate;
    }
    set
    {
      _targets.Clear();
      Combine (value);
    }
  }
}
This code illustrates several interesting points in C# and the CLR. First, note that we check that TDelegate is a delegate type in the constructor. This is because of a limitation in C#—the following type constraint is illegal because C# considers System.Delegate a special type for which constraints are not supported:

 ... where TDelegate : Delegate   // Compiler doesn’t allow this
Instead, we must choose a class constraint and perform a runtime check in the constructor.

In the Combine and Remove methods, we perform the reference conversion from target to Delegate via the as operator rather than the more usual cast operator. This is because C# disallows the cast operator with this type of parameter—because of a potential ambiguity between a custom conversion and a reference conversion.

We then call GetInvocationList because these methods might be called with multicast delegates—delegates with more than one method recipient.

In the Target property, we build up a multicast delegate that combines all the delegates referenced by weak references whose targets are alive, removing the remaining (dead) references from the list to prevent the _targets list from endlessly growing. (We could improve our class by doing the same in the Combine method; yet another improvement would be to add locks for thread safety [see “Locking and Thread Safety”].) We also allow delegates without a weak reference at all; these represent delegates whose target is a static method.

The following illustrates how to consume this delegate in implementing an event:

public class Foo
{
  WeakDelegate<EventHandler> _click = new WeakDelegate<EventHandler>();

  public event EventHandler Click
  {
    add { _click.Combine (value); } remove { _click.Remove (value); }
  }

  protected virtual void OnClick (EventArgs e)
    => _click.Target?.Invoke (this, e);

# Example
ere's an example of how weak references can be used in a caching scenario:

Let's say you have a web application that generates reports for users. Each report takes a considerable amount of time to generate, so you want to cache the results for a certain amount of time to improve performance. However, you don't want to cache all reports indefinitely, as this would consume a lot of memory over time.

To implement this caching behavior, you could use a Dictionary to store the reports, with the report's unique identifier as the key and the generated report as the value. However, to avoid keeping all reports in memory indefinitely, you could use weak references to hold the values in the dictionary.

Here's an example implementation:

scss
Copy code
// Create a dictionary to store reports
Dictionary<string, WeakReference> reportCache = new Dictionary<string, WeakReference>();

// Generate a report and add it to the cache
string reportId = "123";
Report generatedReport = GenerateReport(reportId); // This method generates the report
WeakReference reportRef = new WeakReference(generatedReport);
reportCache.Add(reportId, reportRef);

// Retrieve a report from the cache
if (reportCache.TryGetValue(reportId, out WeakReference cachedReportRef))
{
    if (cachedReportRef.Target != null)
    {
        // If the report is still in memory, use it
        Report cachedReport = (Report)cachedReportRef.Target;
        DisplayReport(cachedReport); // This method displays the report to the user
    }
    else
    {
        // If the report has been garbage collected, remove it from the cache
        reportCache.Remove(reportId);
    }
}
else
{
    // If the report is not in the cache, generate it and add it to the cache
    Report generatedReport = GenerateReport(reportId);
    WeakReference reportRef = new WeakReference(generatedReport);
    reportCache.Add(reportId, reportRef);
    DisplayReport(generatedReport);
}
In this example, when a report is generated, a WeakReference is created to hold the report's reference in the cache. When retrieving a report from the cache, the TryGetValue method is used to check if the report is still in memory. If the report is still in memory, the Target property of the WeakReference is used to access the report. If the report has been garbage collected, it is removed from the cache.

This approach allows the application to keep frequently used reports in memory for a certain amount of time, while allowing less frequently used reports to be garbage collected when memory is needed.
