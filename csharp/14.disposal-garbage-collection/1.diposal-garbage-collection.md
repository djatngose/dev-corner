# Disposal and Garbage Collection
Some objects require explicit tear-down code to release resources such as open files, locks, operating system handles, and unmanaged objects. In .NET parlance, this is called disposal, and it is supported through the IDisposable interface. The managed memory occupied by unused objects must also be reclaimed at some point; this function is known as garbage collection and is performed by the CLR.

Disposal differs from garbage collection in that disposal is usually explicitly instigated; garbage collection is totally automatic. In other words, t`he programmer takes care of such things as releasing file handles, locks, and operating system resources, while the CLR takes care of releasing memory.`

# when call dispose does the memory is clear or need to wait Garbage collector clear automatically in .net?

In .NET, when you call the Dispose() method on an object, it's typically to release unmanaged resources that the object is holding, such as file handles or database connections. `Once the Dispose() method has been called, the unmanaged resources should be immediately released and any cleanup code in the object should be executed.`

However, this does not necessarily mean that the memory used by the object will be immediately released. The garbage collector is responsible for managing memory in .NET and will eventually reclaim memory used by objects that are no longer referenced by the application. So, even` if you call Dispose() on an object(managed object), you may still need to wait for the garbage collector to run before the memory used by the object is actually freed.` e.g  the managed memory used by the MemoryStream object itself will still be subject to garbage collection. This means that even after you dispose of a MemoryStream object, the memory used by the object may not be freed immediately. Instead, the garbage collector will free the memory at some point in the future, when it determines that the memory is no longer needed.

in summary, calling Dispose() on a MemoryStream object releases any unmanaged resources held by the object, but the managed memory used by the object will still be subject to garbage collection. The Dispose() method is important for freeing up resources that cannot be freed by the garbage collector, but it may not immediately free up all memory used by the object.

In general, it's a good practice to call Dispose() on objects that implement the IDisposable interface as soon as you're finished with them, to release any unmanaged resources they're holding as soon as possible. However, 
you should not rely on Dispose() to immediately free up memory used by the object.
