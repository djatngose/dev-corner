# Regex options
The `RegexOptions` flags enum lets you tweak matching behavior. A common use for `RegexOptions` is to perform a `case-insensitive` search:
```c#
Console.WriteLine (Regex.Match ("a", "A", RegexOptions.IgnoreCase)); // a
```

# Combine with OR "|" flag
This applies the current culture’s rules for case equivalence. The `CultureInvariant` flag lets you request the invariant culture instead:
```c#
Console.WriteLine (Regex.Match ("a", "A", RegexOptions.IgnoreCase | RegexOptions.CultureInvariant));
```
`Note`: The `"|"` symbol is the` bitwise OR operator`, which `combines` the two specified RegexOptions flags (IgnoreCase and CultureInvariant) into a single RegexOptions value that is then passed as the third argument to the Match method. This causes the regular expression to ignore case sensitivity and culture differences when performing the match.

You can activate most of the RegexOptions flags within a regular expression itself, using a single-letter code, as follows:
```c#
Console.WriteLine (Regex.Match ("a", @"(?i)A")); // a
```

#  Regular expression options
`IgnoreCase i` : Ignores case (by default, regular expressions are case sensitive)

`Multiline m` : Changes ^ and $ so that they match the start/end of a line instead of start/end of the string

`ExplicitCapture n` : Captures only explicitly named or explicitly numbered group
  - `ExplicitCapture` is an option that changes the default behavior of grouping constructs, such as parentheses `()`, to only capture explicitly named groups.
  - With the `ExplicitCapture` option, only named groups that are explicitly defined using the `(?<name>...)` syntax will be captured. This can help reduce clutter in the capture collection and improve performance.
```c#
string input = "hello world";
string pattern = @"(?<greeting>hello) (?<target>world)";
Match match = Regex.Match(input, pattern, RegexOptions.ExplicitCapture);

Console.WriteLine(match.Groups.Count); // outputs 3
Console.WriteLine(match.Groups["greeting"].Value); // outputs "hello"
Console.WriteLine(match.Groups["target"].Value); // outputs "world"

```

`Compiled` : Forces compilation to IL 

`Singleline s`: Makes . match every character (instead of matching every character except\n)
  - By default, the `.` character in a regular expression matches any character except newline. When the Singleline option is used, the `.` character matches any character `including newline`. This option is also known as the DOTALL option in other regular expression flavors.

```c#
string input = "The quick\nbrown fox\njumps over\nthe lazy\ndog.";
string pattern = @"(?s)fox.+lazy";
Match match = Regex.Match(input, pattern);
Console.WriteLine(match.Value);
//OUTPUT
fox
jumps over
the lazy
```

`IgnorePatternWhitespace x`: Eliminates unescaped whitespace from the pattern

`RightToLeft r`: Searches from right to left; can’t be specified midstream

`ECMAScript`: Forces ECMA compliance (by default, the implementation is not ECMA compliant)
  - This option changes the behavior of certain constructs to be compatible with the ECMAScript regular expression standard. This includes changing the behavior of character classes like `\w, \d, and \s,` as well as disallowing certain constructs like lookbehind assertions.
```c#
string input = "The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.";
string pattern = @"\w+";
MatchCollection matches = Regex.Matches(input, pattern, RegexOptions.ECMAScript);
foreach (Match match in matches)
{
    Console.WriteLine(match.Value);
}
//OUTPUT
The
quick
brown
fox
jumps
over
the
lazy
dog

```
`CultureInvariant`: Turns off culture-specific behavior for string comparisons
