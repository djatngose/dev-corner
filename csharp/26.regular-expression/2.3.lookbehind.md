# Look behind
`(?!expr)` This requires that the match not be followed by expr. The following expression` matches “good” unless “however” or “but” appears` later in the string:
```c#
string regex = "(?i)good(?!.*(however|but))";
Console.WriteLine (Regex.IsMatch ("Good work! But...", regex)); // False
Console.WriteLine (Regex.IsMatch ("Good work! Thanks!", regex)); // True

```

The `(?<=expr)` construct denotes positive lookbehind and requires that a match be preceded by a specified expression. The opposite construct, `(?<!expr)`, denotes negative lookbehind and requires that a match not be preceded by a specified expression. For example, the following matches “good”—unless “however” appears earlier in the string:
```c#
string regex = "(?i)(?<!however.*)good";
Console.WriteLine (Regex.IsMatch ("However good, we...", regex)); // False Console.WriteLine (Regex.IsMatch ("Very good, thanks!", regex)); // True
```
