# Intro
The regular expressions language identifies character patterns. The .NET types sup‐ porting regular expressions are based on Perl 5 regular expressions and support both search and search/replace functionality.
Regular expressions are used for tasks such as:
• Validating text input such as passwords and phone numbers
• Parsing textual data into more structured forms (e.g., a NuGet version string)
• Replacing patterns of text in a document (e.g., whole words only)
This chapter is split into both conceptual sections teaching the basics of regular expressions in .NET, and reference sections describing the regular expressions language.
