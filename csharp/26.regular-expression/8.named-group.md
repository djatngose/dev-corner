# Group
Sometimes, it’s useful to separate a regular expression into a series of subexpres‐ sions, or groups. For instance, consider the following regular expression that repre‐ sents a US phone number such as 206-465-1918:
```c#
\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}
```
Suppose that we want to separate this into two groups: area code and local number. We can achieve this by using parentheses to capture each group:
```c#
    (\d{3})-(\d{3}-\d{4})
```
We then retrieve the groups programmatically:
```c#
Match m = Regex.Match ("206-465-1918", @"(\d{3})-(\d{3}-\d{4})");
Console.WriteLine (m.Groups[1]); // 206
Console.WriteLine (m.Groups[2]); // 465-1918
```
The zeroth group represents the entire match. In other words, it has the same value as the match’s Value:
```c#
    Console.WriteLine (m.Groups[0]);   // 206-465-1918
    Console.WriteLine (m);             // 206-465-1918
```    
Groups are part of the regular expressions language itself. This means that you can refer to a group within a regular expression. The \n syntax lets you index the group by group number n within the expression. For example, the expression (\w)ee\1 matches deed and peep. In the following example, we find all words in a string starting and ending in the same letter:
```c#
foreach (Match m in Regex.Matches ("pop pope peep", @"\b(\w)\w+\1\b"))
   Console.Write (m + " "); // pop peep
```
# Named Groups
In a long or complex expression, it can be easier to work with groups by name rather than index. Here’s a rewrite of the previous example, using a group that we name 'letter':
```c#
string regEx =
      @"\b" + // word boundary
      @"(?'letter'\w)" + // match first letter, and name it 'letter' @"\w+" + // match middle letters
      @"\k'letter'" + // match last letter, denoted by 'letter' @"\b"; // word boundary
  foreach (Match m in Regex.Matches ("bob pope peep", regEx))
      Console.Write (m + " ");  // bob peep
```
Here’s how to name a captured group:
```c#
(?'group-name'group-expr) or (?<group-name>group-expr)
```
And here’s how to refer to a group:
```c#
\k'group-name' or \k<group-name>
```
The following example matches a simple (non-nested) XML/HTML element by
looking for start and end nodes with a matching name:
```c#
string regFind =
@"<(?'tag'\w+?).*>" + // lazy-match first tag, and name it 'tag'
@"(?'text'.*?)" +     // lazy-match text content, name it 'text'
@"</\k'tag'>";        // match last tag, denoted by 'tag'
    Match m = Regex.Match ("<h1>hello</h1>", regFind);
    Console.WriteLine (m.Groups ["tag"]);          // h1
    Console.WriteLine (m.Groups ["text"]);         // hello
```
