# Compiled Regular Expressions
In some of the preceding examples, we called a static RegEx method repeatedly with the same pattern. An alternative approach in these cases is to instantiate a Regex object with the pattern and `RegexOptions.Compiled` and then call instance methods:
```c#
Regex r = new Regex (@"sausages?", RegexOptions.Compiled);
Console.WriteLine (r.Match ("sausage")); // sausage
Console.WriteLine (r.Match ("sausages")); // sausages
```

`RegexOptions.Compiled `instructs the RegEx instance to use `lightweight code generation` (DynamicMethod in Reflection.Emit) to dynamically build and compile code tailored to that particular regular expression. This results in `faster matching, at the expense of an initial compilation cost.`

You can also instantiate a Regex object without using RegexOptions.Compiled. A Regex instance is `immutable`.

`Note`: The regular expressions engine is fast. Even `without compilation, a simple match typically takes less than a microsecond.`
