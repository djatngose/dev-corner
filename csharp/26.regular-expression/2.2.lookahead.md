# Lookahead

The `(?=expr)` construct checks whether the text that follows matches expr, without including expr in the result. This is called positive lookahead. In the following example, we look for a number followed by the word “miles”:
```c#
Console.WriteLine (Regex.Match ("say 25 miles more", @"\d+\s(?=miles)")); // 25
```
`Notice` that the word `“miles”` was not returned in the result, even though it was required to satisfy the match.

After a successful lookahead, matching continues as though the sneak preview never took place. So, if we append `.*` to our expression like this:
```c#
Console.WriteLine (Regex.Match ("say 25 miles more", @"\d+\s(?=miles).*")); // 25 miles more
```

## Strong password rule
`Lookahead` can be useful in enforcing rules for a` strong password`. Suppose that a password must be at least six characters and contain at least one digit. With a lookup, we could achieve this, as follows:
```c#
string password = "...";
bool ok = Regex.IsMatch (password, @"(?=.*\d).{6,}");
```
This first performs a `lookahead` to ensure that a digit occurs somewhere in the string. If satisfied, it returns to its position before the sneak preview began and matches six or more characters. (In “Cookbook Regular Expressions” on page 999, we include a more substantial password validation example.)
