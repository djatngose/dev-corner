# Splitting Text

The static `Regex.Split` method is a more powerful version of the string.Split method, with a regular expression denoting the separator pattern. In this example, we split a string, where any digit counts as a separator:
```c#
foreach (string s in Regex.Split ("a5b7c", @"\d"))
   Console.Write (s + " "); // a b c
```

The result, here, doesn’t include the separators themselves. You can include the sep‐ arators, however, by wrapping the expression in a `positive lookahead`. The following splits a camel-case string into separate words:
```c#
foreach (string s in Regex.Split ("oneTwoThree", @"(?=[A-Z])"))
   Console.Write (s + " "); // one Two Three
```
