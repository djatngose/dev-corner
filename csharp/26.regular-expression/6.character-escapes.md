# Character escapes
Regular expressions have the following metacharacters, which have a special rather than literal meaning:
```c#
\ * + ? | { [ () ^ $ . #
```
To use a metacharacter literally, you must prefix, or escape, the character with a `backslash`. In the following example, we escape the ? character to match the string "what?":
```c#
Console.WriteLine (Regex.Match ("what?", @"what\?")); // what? (correct)
Console.WriteLine (Regex.Match ("what?", @"what?")); // what (incorrect)

```
`Note`: If the character is inside a set (square brackets), this rule does not apply, and the metacharacters are interpreted literally. We discuss sets in the following section.

The Regex’s `Escape and Unescape` methods convert a string containing regular expression metacharacters by replacing them with escaped equivalents, and vice versa:
```c#
Console.WriteLine (Regex.Escape (@"?")); // \?
Console.WriteLine (Regex.Unescape (@"\?")); // ?>
```

All the regular expression strings in this chapter are expressed with the C# @ literal. This is to bypass C#’s escape mechanism, which also uses the backslash. Without the @, a literal backslash would require four backslashes
```c#
Console.WriteLine (Regex.Match ("\\", "\\\\")); // \
```
Unless you include the `(?x)` option, spaces are treated literally in regular expressions:
```c#
Console.Write (Regex.IsMatch ("hello world", @"hello world")); // True
```
