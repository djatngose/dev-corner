# Immutable Collections
We just described how ReadOnlyCollection<T> creates a read-only view of a collection. Restricting the ability to write (mutate) a collection—or any other object—simplifies software and reduces bugs.

The immutable collections extend this principle, by providing collections that cannot be modified at all after initialization. Should you need to add an item to an immutable collection, you must instantiate a new collection, leaving the old one untouched.

`Immutability` is a hallmark of functional programming and has the following benefits:
  - It eliminates a large class of bugs associated with changing state.
  - It vastly simplifies parallelism and multithreading, by preventing most of the thread-safety problems that we describe in Chapters 14, 22, and 23.
  - It makes code easier to reason about.


The `disadvantage of immutability` is that when you need to make a change, you must create a whole new object. This incurs a performance hit, although there are mitigating strategies that we discuss in this section, including the ability to reuse portions of the original structure.

 All collections are defined in the System.Collections.Immutable namespace:
 ```
 Type	Internal structure	 	 
ImmutableArray<T>	Array	 	 
ImmutableList<T>	AVL tree	 	 
ImmutableDictionary<K,V>	AVL tree	 	 
ImmutableHashSet<T>	AVL tree	 	 
ImmutableSortedDictionary<K,V>	AVL tree	 	 
ImmutableSortedSet<T>	AVL tree	 	 
ImmutableStack<T>	Linked list	 	 
ImmutableQueue<T>	Linked list
 ```
The immutable collections expose a public interface similar to their mutable counterparts. The key difference is that the methods that appear to alter the collection (such as Add or Remove) don’t alter the original collection; instead they return a new collection with the requested item added or removed.

For example, suppose you have an immutable list of integers:

```c#
var immutableList = ImmutableList.Create(1, 2, 3);
```
You can access the items in the list, but you cannot add, remove, or replace them:

```c#
// Access items
int item = immutableList[0]; // returns 1

// Attempt to add item (will not compile)
immutableList.Add(4);

// Attempt to remove item (will not compile)
immutableList.Remove(1);

// Attempt to replace item (will not compile)
immutableList[0] = 5;
```
However, you can still modify the individual items in the list:

```c#
// Modify item (works)
immutableList = immutableList.SetItem(0, 5); // returns a new list with item at index 0 set to 5
```
This means that if you need to ensure that the items themselves cannot be modified, you will need to make the items themselves immutable, for example by using immutable data types or creating your own immutable classes.
# Creating Immutable Collections
Each immutable collection type offers a Create<T>() method, which accepts optional initial values and returns an initialized immutable collection:

ImmutableArray<int> array = ImmutableArray.Create<int> (1, 2, 3);
Each collection also offers a CreateRange<T> method, which does the same job as Create<T>; the difference is that its parameter type is IEnumerable<T> instead of params T[].

You can also create an immutable collection from an existing IEnumerable<T>, using appropriate extension methods (ToImmutableArray, ToImmutableList, ToImmutableDictionary, and so on):
```c#
var list = new[] { 1, 2, 3 }.ToImmutableList();

var list1 = new List<int>();
list1.Add(1);
list1.Add(2);
var list2 = list1.ToImmutableList();
list1[0] = 12;
Console.WriteLine(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(list1));
Console.WriteLine(JsonConvert.SerializeObject(list2));
// OUTPUT
// [12,2]
// [1,2]

```
# Manipulating Immutable Collections
The Add method returns a new collection containing the existing elements plus the new one:
```c#
var oldList = ImmutableList.Create<int> (1, 2, 3);

ImmutableList<int> newList = oldList.Add (4);

Console.WriteLine (oldList.Count);     // 3  (unaltered)
Console.WriteLine (newList.Count);     // 4
```
The Remove method operates in the same fashion, returning a new collection with the item removed.

Repeatedly adding or removing elements in this manner is inefficient, because a new immutable collection is created for each add or remove operation. A better solution is to call AddRange (or RemoveRange), which accepts an IEnumerable<T> of items, which are all added or removed in one go:

var anotherList = oldList.AddRange (new[] { 4, 5, 6 });
The immutable list and array also defines Insert and InsertRange methods to insert elements at a particular index, a RemoveAt method to remove at an index, and RemoveAll, which removes based on a predicate.

# Builders
For more complex initialization needs, each immutable collection class defines a builder counterpart. Builders are classes that are functionally equivalent to a mutable collection, with similar performance characteristics. After the data is initialized, calling .ToImmutable() on a builder returns an immutable collection:
```c#
ImmutableArray<int>.Builder builder = ImmutableArray.CreateBuilder<int>();
builder.Add (1);
builder.Add (2);
builder.Add (3);
builder.RemoveAt (0);
ImmutableArray<int> myImmutable = builder.ToImmutable();
```
You also can use builders to batch multiple updates to an existing immutable collection:
```c#
var builder2 = myImmutable.ToBuilder();
builder2.Add (4);      // Efficient
builder2.Remove (2);   // Efficient
...                    // More changes to builder...
// Return a new immutable collection with all the changes applied:
ImmutableArray<int> myImmutable2 = builder2.ToImmutable();
```
# Immutable Collections and Performance
Most of the immutable collections use an `AVL tree `internally, which allows the `add/remove operations to reuse portions of the original internal structure rather than having to re-create the entire thing from scratch`. This reduces the overhead of add/remove operations from potentially huge (with large collections) to just moderately large, but it comes at the cost of making read operations slower. The end result is that most immutable collections are slower than their mutable counterparts for both reading and writing.

The most seriously affected is I`mmutableList<T>, which for both read and add operations is 10 to 200 times slower than List<T> (depending on the size of the list)`. This is why ImmutableArray<T> exists: by using an array inside, it avoids the overhead for read operations (for which it’s comparable in performance to an ordinary mutable array). The flipside is that it’s much slower than (even) ImmutableList<T> for add operations because none of the original structure can be reused.

Hence, ImmutableArray<T> is desirable when you want unimpeded read-performance and don’t expect many subsequent calls to Add or Remove (without using a builder):
```
Type	Read performance	Add performance
ImmutableList<T>	      Slow	Slow
ImmutableArray<T>	      Very fast	Very slow
```
`NOTE`
Calling Remove on an ImmutableArray is more expensive than calling Remove on a List<T>—even in the worst-case scenario of removing the first element—because allocating the new collection places additional load on the garbage collector.

Although the immutable collections as a whole incur a potentially significant performance cost, `it’s important to keep the overall magnitude in perspective. An Add operation on an ImmutableList with a million elements is still likely to occur in less than a microsecond on a typical laptop, and a read operation, in less than 100 nanoseconds`. And, if you need to perform write-operations in a loop, you can avoid the accumulated cost with a builder.

The following factors also work to mitigate the costs:

  - `Immutability allows for easy concurrency and parallelization` (Chapter 23), so you can employ all available cores. Parallelizing with mutable state easily leads to errors and requires the use of locks or concurrent collections, both of which hurt performance.
  - `With immutability, you don’t need to “defensively copy” collections or data structures to guard against unexpected change`. This was a factor in favoring the use of immutable collections in writing recent portions of Visual Studio.
  - In most typical programs, few collections have enough items for the difference to matter.

# what is defensively copy?
Defensive copying is a programming technique that involves creating a copy of an object or data structure to protect it from unintended modifications by other parts of the code.

In practice, defensive copying means creating a new instance of an object or data structure and copying its contents to the new instance. This ensures that any changes made to the new instance do not affect the original object or data structure. Defensive copying is particularly important for mutable objects, which can be modified by multiple parts of the code, as it helps prevent unintended side effects and race conditions.

Defensive copying can be used in a variety of programming scenarios, such as when passing objects between threads or when creating defensive copies of objects returned from external libraries or APIs. By creating a defensive copy of an object, you can ensure that the original object remains unmodified and that your code behaves predictably and correctly.
```c#
public class Person
{
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}

public class MyClass
{
    private List<Person> _people = new List<Person>();

    // Returns a defensive copy of the list of people
    public List<Person> GetPeople()
    {
        // Create a new list instance and copy the contents of _people to it
        List<Person> copy = new List<Person>(_people.Count);
        foreach (Person p in _people)
        {
            copy.Add(new Person { Name = p.Name, Age = p.Age });
        }
        return copy;
    }

    // Adds a new person to the list
    public void AddPerson(Person person)
    {
        // Create a new Person instance with the same properties as the input
        Person copy = new Person { Name = person.Name, Age = person.Age };

        // Add the new person to the list
        _people.Add(copy);
    }
}

```
In this example, MyClass contains a private list of Person objects. The GetPeople method returns a defensive copy of the list by creating a new instance of List<Person> and copying the contents of _people to it. This ensures that any modifications made to the returned list do not affect the original _people list.

Similarly, the AddPerson method uses defensive copying to add a new Person object to the list. Instead of adding the input object directly to the list, it creates a new instance of Person with the same properties and adds the new instance to the list. This ensures that any modifications made to the input object after it is added to the list do not affect the list.

# why ImmutableList is slow at read and add operation in c#?
ImmutableList is slower at adding and removing items compared to other collection types like List because it is immutable. When you add or remove an item from an immutable list, a new list instance is created with the updated items. This means that adding or removing an item involves creating a new instance of the list and copying all the existing items to the new instance.

In contrast, a List can be modified directly by adding or removing items from the underlying array, which can be more efficient for large collections. List is designed to be mutable and is optimized for adding and removing items, while ImmutableList is optimized for scenarios where immutability is more important than performance.

However, ImmutableList can be faster than List for certain scenarios, such as when you need to perform many read-only operations on the collection or when you need to ensure that the collection is never modified by other code.

It is important to note that the performance differences between collection types may be negligible in many scenarios and may not significantly impact the overall performance of your application. It is always a good idea to measure the performance of your code and choose the collection type that is most appropriate for your specific use case.

# why ImmutableArray is very fast at read but very slow at add operation in c#?
ImmutableArray is designed to be very fast at read operations because it is implemented as a simple array that is immutable. The items in the array cannot be modified once the array is created, which makes it easy to optimize read operations.

However, adding or removing an item from an ImmutableArray involves creating a new instance of the array with the updated items. This operation can be slow for large arrays because it requires copying all the existing items to the new array instance. Therefore, ImmutableArray is slower at adding or removing items compared to other collection types like List.

It is worth noting that ImmutableArray can be faster than List for certain scenarios, such as when you need to perform many read-only operations on the collection or when you need to ensure that the collection is never modified by other code.

Overall, the choice of collection type depends on the specific use case and performance requirements of your application. It is always a good idea to measure the performance of your code and choose the collection type that best fits your needs.
