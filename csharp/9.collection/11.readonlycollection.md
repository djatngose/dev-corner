# ReadOnlyCollection<T>
ReadOnlyCollection<T> is a wrapper, or proxy, that provides a read-only view of a collection. This is useful in allowing a class to publicly expose read-only access to a collection that the class can still update internally.

A read-only collection accepts the input collection in its constructor, to which it maintains a permanent reference. It doesnâ€™t take a static copy of the input collection, so subsequent changes to the input collection are visible through the read-only wrapper.

To illustrate, suppose that your class wants to provide read-only public access to a list of strings called Names. We could do this as follows:

public class Test
{
  List<string> names = new List<string>();
  public IReadOnlyList<string> Names => names;
}
Although Names returns a read-only interface, the consumer can still downcast at runtime to List<string> or IList<string> and then call Add, Remove, or Clear on the list. ReadOnlyCollection<T> provides a more robust solution:

public class Test
{
  List<string> names = new List<string>();
  public ReadOnlyCollection<string> Names { get; private set; }

  public Test() => Names = new ReadOnlyCollection<string> (names);

  public void AddInternally() => names.Add ("test");
}
Now, only members within the Test class can alter the list of names:

Test t = new Test();

Console.WriteLine (t.Names.Count);       // 0
t.AddInternally();
Console.WriteLine (t.Names.Count);       // 1

t.Names.Add ("test");                    // Compiler error
((IList<string>) t.Names).Add ("test");  // NotSupportedException
