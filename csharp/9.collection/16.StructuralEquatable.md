# IStructuralEquatable and IStructuralComparable
As we discussed in Chapter 6, structs implement structural comparison by default: two structs are equal if all of their fields are equal. Sometimes, however, structural equality and order comparison are useful as plug-in options on other types, as well—such as arrays. The following interfaces help with this:

public interface IStructuralEquatable
{
  bool Equals (object other, IEqualityComparer comparer);
  int GetHashCode (IEqualityComparer comparer);
}

public interface IStructuralComparable
{
  int CompareTo (object other, IComparer comparer);
}
The IEqualityComparer/IComparer that you pass in are applied to each individual element in the composite object. We can demonstrate this by using arrays. In the following example, we compare two arrays for equality, first using the default Equals method, then using IStructuralEquatable’s version:

int[] a1 = { 1, 2, 3 };
int[] a2 = { 1, 2, 3 };
IStructuralEquatable se1 = a1;
Console.Write (a1.Equals (a2));                                  // False
Console.Write (se1.Equals (a2, EqualityComparer<int>.Default));  // True
Here’s another example:

string[] a1 = "the quick brown fox".Split();
string[] a2 = "THE QUICK BROWN FOX".Split();
IStructuralEquatable se1 = a1;
bool isTrue = se1.Equals (a2, StringComparer.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase);
1 There’s also a functionally identical nongeneric version of this called SortedList.
