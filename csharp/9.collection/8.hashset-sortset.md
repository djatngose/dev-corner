# what are operations are destructive?
In computer science, an operation is said to be destructive `if it modifies the original input data or structure. This means that the original data is changed or overwritten by the operation, and cannot be recovered in its original form.`

Examples of destructive operations include:

`Sorting`: When you sort a list or array, the original order of the elements is lost.

`Filtering`: When you apply a filter to a data set, the original set is modified to include only the filtered elements.

`Removing elements`: When you remove an element from a list or array, the original list or array is modified, and the removed element is lost.

`Truncating`: When you truncate a file or a data set, the original content is lost.

`Updating`: When you update a record in a database, the original data is modified to reflect the new values.

It is important to be aware of destructive operations when working with data, as they can have unintended consequences and potentially lead to data loss. It is often a good practice to make a copy of the original data before applying any destructive operations, so that the original data can be restored if necessary.


#  HashSet<T> and SortedSet<T>
HashSet<T> and SortedSet<T> have the following distinguishing features:
  - Their Contains methods execute quickly using a hash-based lookup.
  - They do not store duplicate elements and silently ignore requests to add duplicates.
  - You cannot access an element by position.

`SortedSet<T> keeps elements in order, whereas HashSet<T> does not.`

```c#
HashSet<int> hashSet = new HashSet<int> { 4, 1, 3, 2 };
SortedSet<int> sortedSet = new SortedSet<int> { 4, 1, 3, 2 };

Console.WriteLine("HashSet:");
foreach (var item in hashSet)
{
    Console.WriteLine(item);
}

Console.WriteLine("SortedSet:");
foreach (var item in sortedSet)
{
    Console.WriteLine(item);
}
//OUTPUT
HashSet:
4
1
3
2

SortedSet:
1
2
3
4
```

The commonality of the `HashSet<T> and SortedSet<T>` types is captured by the interface ISet<T>. From .NET 5, these classes also implement an interface called IReadOnlySet<T>, which is also implemented by the immutable set types

`HashSet<T> is implemented with a hashtable that stores just keys; SortedSet<T> is implemented with a red/black tree.`

Both collections implement `ICollection<T>` and offer methods that you would expect, such as Contains, Add, and Remove. In addition, there’s a predicate-based removal method called RemoveWhere.
The following constructs a HashSet<char> from an existing collection, tests for membership, and then enumerates the collection (notice the absence of duplicates):
```c#
var letters = new HashSet<char> ("the quick brown fox");

Console.WriteLine (letters.Contains ('t'));      // true
Console.WriteLine (letters.Contains ('j'));      // false

foreach (char c in letters) Console.Write (c);   // the quickbrownfx
```
(The reason we can pass a string into HashSet<char>’s constructor is that string implements IEnumerable<char>.)

The really interesting methods are the set operations. The following set `operations are destructive` in that they modify the set:
```c#
public void UnionWith           (IEnumerable<T> other);   // Adds
public void IntersectWith       (IEnumerable<T> other);   // Removes
public void ExceptWith          (IEnumerable<T> other);   // Removes
public void SymmetricExceptWith (IEnumerable<T> other);   // Removes
```
whereas the following methods simply query the set and so are nondestructive:
```c#
public bool IsSubsetOf         (IEnumerable<T> other);
public bool IsProperSubsetOf   (IEnumerable<T> other);
public bool IsSupersetOf       (IEnumerable<T> other);
public bool IsProperSupersetOf (IEnumerable<T> other);
public bool Overlaps           (IEnumerable<T> other);
public bool SetEquals          (IEnumerable<T> other);
```
`UnionWith` adds all the elements in the second set to the original set (excluding duplicates).
`IntersectWith` removes the elements that are not in both sets. We can extract all of the vowels from our set of characters as follows:
```c#
var letters = new HashSet<char> ("the quick brown fox");
letters.IntersectWith ("aeiou");
foreach (char c in letters) Console.Write (c);     // euio
```

`ExceptWith` removes the specified elements from the source set. Here, we strip all vowels from the set:
```c#
var letters = new HashSet<char> ("the quick brown fox");
letters.ExceptWith ("aeiou");
foreach (char c in letters) Console.Write (c);     // th qckbrwnfx
```

`SymmetricExceptWith` removes all but the elements that are unique to one set or the other:
```c#
var letters = new HashSet<char> ("the quick brown fox");
letters.SymmetricExceptWith ("the lazy brown fox");
foreach (char c in letters) Console.Write (c);     // quicklazy
```
# Note that because HashSet<T> and SortedSet<T> implement IEnumerable<T>, you can use another type of set (or collection) as the argument to any of the set operation methods.
Suppose you have two HashSet<int> objects set1 and set2, and you want to find the union of these two sets. Normally, you would use the UnionWith method to add all the elements of set2 to set1, like this:

```c#
HashSet<int> set1 = new HashSet<int>() { 1, 2, 3 };
HashSet<int> set2 = new HashSet<int>() { 3, 4, 5 };

set1.UnionWith(set2);
```
This modifies set1 by adding the elements 4 and 5 to it.

However, suppose you also have a List<int> object list containing some elements that you want to add to set1 as well. You could convert list to a HashSet<int> object and then use UnionWith, but there's an easier way: you can pass list directly to UnionWith because it implements IEnumerable<int>. Here's how you would do it:

```c#
List<int> list = new List<int>() { 5, 6, 7 };

set1.UnionWith(list);
```
This modifies set1 again by adding the elements 6 and 7 to it.

Note that you can also use any other collection that implements IEnumerable<int> in place of list, such as an array or another HashSet<int> object. This makes the set operations more flexible and allows you to combine sets in many different ways.

# SortedSet
SortedSet<T> offers all the members of HashSet<T>, plus the following:
```c#
public virtual SortedSet<T> GetViewBetween (T lowerValue, T upperValue)
public IEnumerable<T> Reverse()
public T Min { get; }
public T Max { get; }
```
SortedSet<T> also accepts an optional IComparer<T> in its constructor (rather than an equality comparer).

Here’s an example of loading the same letters into a SortedSet<char>:
```c#
var letters = new SortedSet<char> ("the quick brown fox");
foreach (char c in letters) Console.Write (c);   //  bcefhiknoqrtuwx
```
Following on from this, we can obtain the letters in the set between f and i as follows:
```c#
foreach (char c in letters.GetViewBetween ('f', 'i'))
  Console.Write (c);                                    //  fhi
```
