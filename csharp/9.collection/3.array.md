# The Array Class
The Array class is the implicit base class for all single and multidimensional arrays, and it is one of the most fundamental types implementing the standard collection interfaces. The Array class provides type unification, so a common set of methods is available to all arrays, regardless of their declaration or underlying element type.

Because arrays are so fundamental, C# provides explicit syntax for their declaration and initialization, which we described in Chapters 2 and 3. When an array is declared using C#’s syntax, the CLR implicitly subtypes the Array class—synthesizing a pseudotype appropriate to the array’s dimensions and element types. This pseudotype implements the typed generic collection interfaces, such as IList<string>.

`The CLR also treats array types specially upon construction, assigning them a contiguous space in memory. This makes indexing into arrays highly efficient, but prevents them from being resized later on.`

`Array implements the collection interfaces up to IList<T> in both their generic and nongeneric forms`. IList<T> itself is implemented explicitly, though, to keep Array’s public interface clean of methods such as Add or Remove, which throw an exception on fixed-length collections such as arrays. T`he Array class does actually offer a static Resize method`, although this works by creating a new array and then copying over each element. `As well as being inefficient, references to the array elsewhere in the program will still point to the original version. A better solution for resizable collections is to use the List<T> class (described in the following section).`


```c#
  public abstract class Array : 
    ICloneable,
    IList,
    ICollection,
    IEnumerable,
    IStructuralComparable,
    IStructuralEquatable
  {
  }
```
An array can contain value-type or reference-type elements. Value-type elements are stored in place in the array, so an array of three long integers (each 8 bytes) will occupy 24 bytes of contiguous memory. A reference type element, however, occupies only as much space in the array as a reference (4 bytes in a 32-bit environment or 8 bytes in a 64-bit environment). Figure 7-2 illustrates the effect, in memory, of the following program:
```c#
StringBuilder[] builders = new StringBuilder [5];
builders [0] = new StringBuilder ("builder1");
builders [1] = new StringBuilder ("builder2");
builders [2] = new StringBuilder ("builder3");

long[] numbers = new long [3];
numbers [0] = 12345;
numbers [1] = 54321;

```
Because Array is a class, arrays are always (themselves) reference types—regardless of the array’s element type. This means that the statement arrayB = arrayA results in two variables that reference the same array. Similarly, two distinct arrays will always fail an equality test, unless you employ a structural equality comparer, which compares every element of the array:

```c#
object[] a1 = { "string", 123, true };
object[] a2 = { "string", 123, true };

Console.WriteLine (a1 == a2);                          // False
Console.WriteLine (a1.Equals (a2));                    // False

IStructuralEquatable se1 = a1;
Console.WriteLine (se1.Equals (a2,
 StructuralComparisons.StructuralEqualityComparer));   // True
```

Arrays can be duplicated by calling the Clone method: arrayB = arrayA.Clone(). However, this results in a shallow clone, meaning that only the memory represented by the array itself is copied. If the array contains value-type objects, the values themselves are copied; if the array contains reference type objects, just the references are copied (resulting in two arrays whose members reference the same objects). Figure 7-3 demonstrates the effect of adding the following code to our example:

StringBuilder[] builders2 = builders;
StringBuilder[] shallowClone = (StringBuilder[]) builders.Clone();

To create a deep copy—for which reference type subobjects are duplicated—you must loop through the array and clone each element manually. The same rules apply to other .NET collection types.

Although Array is designed primarily for use with 32-bit indexers, it also has limited support for 64-bit indexers (allowing an array to theoretically address up to 264 elements) via several methods that accept both Int32 and Int64 parameters. These overloads are useless in practice because the CLR does not permit any object—including arrays—to exceed two gigabytes in size (whether running on a 32- or 64-bit environment).

Construction and Indexing
The easiest way to create and index arrays is through C#’s language constructs:

int[] myArray = { 1, 2, 3 };
int first = myArray [0];
int last = myArray [myArray.Length - 1];
Alternatively, you can instantiate an array dynamically by calling Array.Create​In⁠stance. This allows you to specify element type and rank (number of dimensions) at runtime as well as allowing nonzero-based arrays through specifying a lower bound. Nonzero-based arrays are not compatible with the .NET Common Language Specification (CLS) and should not be exposed as public members in a library that might be consumed by a program written in F# or Visual Basic.

The GetValue and SetValue methods let you access elements in a dynamically created array (they also work on ordinary arrays):

 // Create a string array 2 elements in length:
 Array a = Array.CreateInstance (typeof(string), 2);
 a.SetValue ("hi", 0);                             //  → a[0] = "hi";
 a.SetValue ("there", 1);                          //  → a[1] = "there";
 string s = (string) a.GetValue (0);               //  → s = a[0];

 // We can also cast to a C# array as follows:
 string[] cSharpArray = (string[]) a;
 string s2 = cSharpArray [0];

 # Enumeration
Arrays are easily enumerated with a foreach statement:

int[] myArray = { 1, 2, 3};
foreach (int val in myArray)
  Console.WriteLine (val);
You can also enumerate using the static Array.ForEach method, defined as follows:

public static void ForEach<T> (T[] array, Action<T> action);
This uses an Action delegate, with this signature:

public delegate void Action<T> (T obj);
Here’s the first example rewritten with Array.ForEach:

Array.ForEach (new[] { 1, 2, 3 }, Console.WriteLine);

# Length and Rank
Array provides the following methods and properties for querying length and rank:

public int  GetLength      (int dimension);
public long GetLongLength  (int dimension);

public int  Length       { get; }
public long LongLength   { get; }

public int GetLowerBound (int dimension);
public int GetUpperBound (int dimension);

public int Rank { get; }    // Returns number of dimensions in array
GetLength and GetLongLength return the length for a given dimension (0 for a single-dimensional array), and Length and LongLength return the total number of elements in the array—all dimensions included.

GetLowerBound and GetUpperBound are useful with nonzero indexed arrays. Get​Up⁠perBound returns the same result as adding GetLowerBound to GetLength for any given dimension.

# Searching
The Array class offers a range of methods for finding elements within a one-dimensional array:

BinarySearch methods
For rapidly searching a sorted array for a particular item
IndexOf/LastIndex methods
For searching unsorted arrays for a particular item
Find/FindLast/FindIndex/FindLastIndex/FindAll/Exists/TrueForAll
For searching unsorted arrays for item(s) that satisfy a given Predicate<T>
None of the array searching methods throws an exception if the specified value is not found. Instead, if an item is not found, methods returning an integer return −1 (assuming a zero-indexed array), and methods returning a generic type return the type’s default value (e.g., 0 for an int, or null for a string).

The binary search methods are fast, but they work only on sorted arrays and require that the elements be compared for order rather than simply equality. To this effect, the binary search methods can accept an IComparer or IComparer<T> object to arbitrate on ordering decisions (see “Plugging in Equality and Order”). This must be consistent with any comparer used in originally sorting the array. If no comparer is provided, the type’s default ordering algorithm will be applied based on its implementation of IComparable / IComparable<T>.

The IndexOf and LastIndexOf methods perform a simple enumeration over the array, returning the position of the first (or last) element that matches the given value.

The predicate-based searching methods allow a method delegate or lambda expression to arbitrate on whether a given element is a “match.” A predicate is simply a delegate accepting an object and returning true or false:

public delegate bool Predicate<T> (T object);
In the following example, we search an array of strings for a name containing the letter “a”:

string[] names = { "Rodney", "Jack", "Jill" };
string match = Array.Find (names, ContainsA);
Console.WriteLine (match);     // Jack

ContainsA (string name) { return name.Contains ("a"); }
Here’s the same code shortened with a lambda expression:

string[] names = { "Rodney", "Jack", "Jill" };
string match = Array.Find (names, n => n.Contains ("a"));     // Jack
FindAll returns an array of all items satisfying the predicate. In fact, it’s equivalent to Enumerable.Where in the System.Linq namespace, except that FindAll returns an array of matching items rather than an IEnumerable<T> of the same.

Exists returns true if any array member satisfies the given predicate, and is equivalent to Any in System.Linq.Enumerable.

TrueForAll returns true if all items satisfy the predicate, and is equivalent to All in System.Linq.Enumerable.

# orting
Array has the following built-in sorting methods:

// For sorting a single array:

public static void Sort<T> (T[] array);
public static void Sort    (Array array);

// For sorting a pair of arrays:

public static void Sort<TKey,TValue> (TKey[] keys, TValue[] items);
public static void Sort              (Array keys, Array items);
Each of these methods is additionally overloaded to also accept the following:

int index                 // Starting index at which to begin sorting
int length                // Number of elements to sort
IComparer<T> comparer     // Object making ordering decisions
Comparison<T> comparison  // Delegate making ordering decisions
The following illustrates the simplest use of Sort:

int[] numbers = { 3, 2, 1 };
Array.Sort (numbers);                     // Array is now { 1, 2, 3 }
The methods accepting a pair of arrays work by rearranging the items of each array in tandem, basing the ordering decisions on the first array. In the next example, both the numbers and their corresponding words are sorted into numerical order:

int[] numbers = { 3, 2, 1 };
string[] words = { "three", "two", "one" };
Array.Sort (numbers, words);

// numbers array is now { 1, 2, 3 }
// words   array is now { "one", "two", "three" }
Array.Sort requires that the elements in the array implement IComparable (see “Order Comparison”). This means that most built-in C# types (such as integers, as in the preceding example) can be sorted. If the elements are not intrinsically comparable or you want to override the default ordering, you must provide Sort with a custom comparison provider that reports on the relative position of two elements. There are ways to do this:

Via a helper object that implements IComparer /IComparer<T> (see “Plugging in Equality and Order”)

Via a Comparison delegate:

public delegate int Comparison<T> (T x, T y);
The Comparison delegate follows the same semantics as IComparer<T>.CompareTo: if x comes before y, a negative integer is returned; if x comes after y, a positive integer is returned; if x and y have the same sorting position, 0 is returned.

In the following example, we sort an array of integers such that the odd numbers come first:

int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
Array.Sort (numbers, (x, y) => x % 2 == y % 2 ? 0 : x % 2 == 1 ? -1 : 1);

// numbers array is now { 1, 3, 5, 2, 4 }
NOTE
As an alternative to calling Sort, you can use LINQ’s OrderBy and ThenBy operators. Unlike Array.Sort, the LINQ operators don’t alter the original array, instead emitting the sorted result in a fresh IEnumerable<T> sequence.

# eversing Elements
The following Array methods reverse the order of all—or a portion of—elements in an array:

public static void Reverse (Array array);
public static void Reverse (Array array, int index, int length);
Copying
Array provides four methods to perform shallow copying: Clone, CopyTo, Copy, and ConstrainedCopy. The former two are instance methods; the latter two are static methods.

The Clone method returns a whole new (shallow-copied) array. The CopyTo and Copy methods copy a contiguous subset of the array. Copying a multidimensional rectangular array requires you to map the multidimensional index to a linear index. For example, the middle square (position[1,1]) in a 3 × 3 array is represented with the index 4, from the calculation: 1 * 3 + 1. The source and destination ranges can overlap without causing a problem.

ConstrainedCopy performs an atomic operation: if all of the requested elements cannot be successfully copied (due to a type error, for instance), the operation is rolled back.

Array also provides an AsReadOnly method that returns a wrapper that prevents elements from being reassigned.

Converting and Resizing
Array.ConvertAll creates and returns a new array of element type TOutput, calling the supplied Converter delegate to copy over the elements. Converter is defined as follows:

public delegate TOutput Converter<TInput,TOutput> (TInput input)
The following converts an array of floats to an array of integers:

float[] reals = { 1.3f, 1.5f, 1.8f };
int[] wholes = Array.ConvertAll (reals, r => Convert.ToInt32 (r));

// wholes array is { 1, 2, 2 }
The Resize method works by creating a new array and copying over the elements, returning the new array via the reference parameter. However, any references to the original array in other objects will remain unchanged.

NOTE
The System.Linq namespace offers an additional buffet of extension methods suitable for array conversion. These methods return an IEnumerable<T>, which you can convert back to an array via Enumerable’s ToArray method.

# When to use Array and List?
oth Array<T> and List<T> are used to store collections of elements in C#, but there are some differences in their implementation and usage that make them better suited for different scenarios.

Array<T> is a fixed-size collection that stores elements of a specific type T. Once an array is created, its size cannot be changed. You can access its elements using an index, which is an integer value that specifies the position of an element in the array. `Arrays are efficient for storing and accessing large amounts of data, but less efficient when it comes to adding or removing elements, as it requires creating a new array with the new size and copying the existing elements to it`.
  - When you know the size of the collection in advance: Arrays are more efficient than lists when you know the number of elements in advance, because you can allocate the exact amount of memory needed for the collection. Lists, on the other hand, have to allocate more memory than is needed to allow for growth.
  - When you need a fixed-size collection: Arrays have a fixed size once they are created, which can be useful when you need to ensure that the collection remains the same size throughout the program.
   - When you need to store value types: Arrays can store value types directly in the collection, whereas lists must box value types into reference types, which can be less efficient.
  - When you need direct access to elements: Arrays offer direct access to elements using an index, whereas lists require an extra step of getting an enumerator or using the Count property to access elements.

List<T>, on the other hand, is a dynamic-size collection that stores elements of a specific type T. You can add or remove elements from a list, and its size will automatically adjust to accommodate the new elements. You can access its elements using an index, just like with arrays. `Lists are less efficient for storing and accessing large amounts of data, but more efficient when it comes to adding or removing elements.  lists are more flexible than arrays, and they have additional features like automatic resizing and built-in methods for adding, removing, and sorting element`s.
  - Dynamic sizing: When the size of the collection is not known in advance, List<T> is preferred because it can dynamically increase or decrease its size, while an array has a fixed size.
  - Easy manipulation: List<T> provides several methods for easy manipulation of items such as Add, Remove, Insert, and Sort, while manipulating items in an array requires more complex code.
  - Performance: In some scenarios, List<T> may perform better than an array because it provides a faster way to resize the collection, uses less memory, and provides more efficient memory allocation.
  - API compatibility: Many APIs and libraries in .NET return List<T> objects, making it easier to work with them directly, rather than converting them to arrays.

So, you should use Array<T> when you need a fixed-size collection that is accessed frequently and where performance is a concern, such as in high-performance scientific computing or graphics applications. You should use List<T> when you need a collection that can be resized dynamically and where ease of use is a concern, such as in user interface development or data manipulation scenarios.
