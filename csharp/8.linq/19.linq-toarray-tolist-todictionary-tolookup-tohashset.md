# ToArray, ToList, ToDictionary, ToHashSet, and ToLookup
ToArray, ToList, and ToHashSet emit the results into an array, List<T> or HashSet<T>. When they execute, these operators force the immediate enumeration of the input sequence. For examples, refer to “Deferred Execution” in Chapter 8.

# ToDictionary and ToLookup accept the following arguments:

Argument	Type
Input sequence	IEnumerable<TSource>
Key selector	TSource => TKey
Element selector (optional)	TSource => TElement
Comparer (optional)	IEqualityComparer<TKey>
ToDictionary also forces immediate execution of a sequence, writing the results to a generic Dictionary. The keySelector expression you provide must evaluate to a unique value for each element in the input sequence; otherwise, an exception is thrown. In contrast, ToLookup allows many elements of the same key. We described lookups in “Joining with lookups”.

# AsEnumerable and AsQueryable
AsEnumerable upcasts a sequence to IEnumerable<T>, forcing the compiler to bind subsequent query operators to methods in Enumerable instead of Queryable. For an example, see “Combining Interpreted and Local Queries”.

AsQueryable downcasts a sequence to IQueryable<T> if it implements that interface. Otherwise, it instantiates an IQueryable<T> wrapper over the local query.
