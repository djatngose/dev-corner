# DefaultIfEmpty
DefaultIfEmpty returns a sequence containing a single element whose value is default(TSource) if the input sequence has no elements; otherwise, it returns the input sequence unchanged. You use this in writing flat outer joins: see “Outer joins with SelectMany” and “Flat outer joins”.
