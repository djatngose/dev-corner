# The Zip Operator
IEnumerable<TFirst>, IEnumerable<TSecond>â†’IEnumerable<TResult>

The Zip operator enumerates two sequences in step (like a zipper), returning a sequence based on applying a function over each element pair. For instance, the following:
```c#
nt[] numbers = { 3, 5, 7 };
string[] words = { "three", "five", "seven", "ignored" };
IEnumerable<string> zip = numbers.Zip (words, (n, w) => n + "=" + w);
```
produces a sequence with the following elements:
```c#
3=three
5=five
7=seven
```
`Extra elements in either input sequence are ignored`.
`Zip is not supported by EF Core.`
