# All and SequenceEqual
All returns true if all elements satisfy a predicate. The following returns customers whose purchases are less than $100:

dbContext.Customers.Where (c => c.Purchases.All (p => p.Price < 100));
SequenceEqual compares two sequences. To return true, each sequence must have identical elements, in the identical order. You can optionally provide an equality comparer; the default is EqualityComparer<T>.Default.
