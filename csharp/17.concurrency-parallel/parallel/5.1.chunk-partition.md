# Chunk partitioning
Chunk partitioning works by having each worker thread periodically grab small “chunks” of elements from the input sequence to process (see Figure 22-4). 

PLINQ starts by allocating very small chunks (one or two elements at a time). It then increases the chunk size as the query progresses: this ensures that small sequences are effectively parallelized and large sequences don’t cause excessive round-tripping.

 If a worker happens to get “easy” elements (that process quickly), it will end up getting more chunks. This system keeps every thread equally busy (and the cores “balanced”);
 
# Example
Assume we have a sequence of 10 elements: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`.

We use PLINQ to process this sequence in parallel using 4 threads with a default chunk size of 1:
```c#
using System.Linq;

var data = Enumerable.Range(1, 10);

var result = data.AsParallel()
    .WithDegreeOfParallelism(4)
    .Select(chunk => chunk * 2)
    .ToList();

```

This means that PLINQ will partition the input sequence into small chunks of size 1 and distribute them across the 4 threads.

Here's an example of how the chunks might be distributed across the threads:
```c#
Thread 1: [1] [5] [9]
Thread 2: [2] [6] [10]
Thread 3: [3] [7]
Thread 4: [4] [8]

```
As each thread finishes processing its chunk, it will grab another chunk until there are no more chunks left. The chunk size will gradually increase as the query progresses, ensuring that small sequences are effectively parallelized and large sequences don't cause excessive round-tripping.

Here's an example of how the chunk size might increase as the query progresses:
```c#
Thread 1: [1] [2, 5] [9, 10]
Thread 2: [6] [4, 8]
Thread 3: [3, 7]

```
In this example, we can see that the chunk size has increased to 2 and even 3 as the query progresses. This ensures that small sequences are effectively parallelized, while larger sequences don't cause excessive round-tripping or contention.

Overall, this example demonstrates how PLINQ's chunk partitioning strategy balances workload and ensures optimal parallelism and performance for different input sequence sizes.

# what is  input sequence in chunk partition?
In the context of chunk partitioning, the input sequence refers to the collection of data that you want to process in parallel. This sequence can be any object that implements the `IEnumerable<T>` interface, such as an array, list, or query result.

# Downside
The only `downside` is that fetching elements from the shared input sequence requires synchronization (typically an exclusive lock)—and this can result in some overhead and contention.

Let's say we have a list of integers that we want to process in parallel using PLINQ's chunk partitioning strategy:

```c#
var inputList = Enumerable.Range(1, 1000).ToList();

```
We want to apply some computation to each element of the list using PLINQ and then aggregate the results. Here's the PLINQ query we might use:
```c#
var result = inputList.AsParallel()
                      .WithDegreeOfParallelism(4)
                      .Select(x => SomeComputation(x))
                      .Aggregate((x, y) => x + y);

```

In this example, we're using a degree of parallelism of 4, which means that PLINQ will use 4 threads to process the input sequence in parallel.

When PLINQ partitions the input sequence into chunks and distributes them across the threads, it needs to ensure that each thread has exclusive access to the elements in its assigned chunk to avoid race conditions and other synchronization issues. This means that PLINQ uses an exclusive lock to protect the chunk of elements that each thread is processing.

However, this exclusive locking mechanism can cause contention and overhead if multiple threads need to access the same chunk of elements at the same time. For example, if one thread is processing the first element of a chunk and another thread needs to process the last element of the same chunk, the second thread will have to wait for the first thread to release the lock before it can access the chunk.

This can result in some overhead and contention, especially if the chunks are small and the computation performed on each element is relatively fast. In such cases, the overhead of locking and synchronization can be greater than the actual time spent performing the computation.

To minimize this overhead and contention, PLINQ uses a dynamic chunk size strategy that increases the chunk size as the query progresses, which reduces the number of times threads need to acquire and release locks on the input sequence. However, this strategy may not be effective in all cases, and you may need to experiment with different chunk sizes and degrees of parallelism to find the optimal configuration for your specific scenario.

# Use cases
`Image processing`: If you need to perform image processing operations on a large collection of images, you can use chunk partitioning to distribute the images across multiple threads and process them in parallel.

`Data analysis`: If you have a large dataset that needs to be analyzed, you can use chunk partitioning to split the dataset into smaller chunks and process them in parallel to speed up the analysis.

`Web scraping`: If you need to scrape data from a large number of web pages, you can use chunk partitioning to distribute the URLs across multiple threads and scrape the pages in parallel.

`Machine learning`: If you need to train a machine learning model on a large dataset, you can use chunk partitioning to split the dataset into smaller chunks and train the model in parallel to speed up the training process.

# When to use chunk partition over range partition and via versa?

`Chunk partitioning` divides the input data into small chunks and distributes them to worker threads for parallel processing. This is useful `when the size of the input data is not known in advance and when each chunk can be processed independently`.

On the other hand, `range partitioning` divides the input data into non-overlapping ranges and assigns each range to a different worker thread. This is useful `when the size of the input data is known in advance and when each range requires roughly the same amount of processing time`.

So, when to use each technique depends on the characteristics of your input data and the type of processing you need to perform. If your input data is of variable size and can be processed independently in small chunks, then chunk partitioning might be a good choice. If your input data is of a known size and requires roughly the same amount of processing time for each range, then range partitioning might be more suitable.

n general, `chunk partitioning can be more flexible and efficient for parallelizing small and medium-sized data sets, while range partitioning can be more efficient for larger data sets.`

# Use cases
Chunk Partitioning:
- When the size of the input data is not known in advance
- When each chunk can be processed independently and quickly
- When the processing time per element is variable
- When the data is not easily partitionable into ranges
- When the data size is small or medium

Examples of use cases for chunk partitioning include:
  - Image or video processing, where each frame can be processed independently
  - Natural language processing, where sentences can be processed independently
  - Data analysis, where each data point can be analyzed independently
