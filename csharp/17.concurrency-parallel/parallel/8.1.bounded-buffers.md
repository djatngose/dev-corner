# bounded buffer
A bounded buffer, also known as a bounded queue or circular buffer, is a data structure that is used to transfer data between two or more threads or processes in a producer-consumer scenario. It has a fixed size or capacity, which limits the number of elements it can hold at any given time.

In a producer-consumer scenario, one or more producer threads add elements to the buffer, while one or more consumer threads remove elements from the buffer. If the buffer becomes full, the producer threads block (i.e., wait) until space becomes available, while if the buffer becomes empty, the consumer threads block until new elements become available.

Bounded buffers can be implemented in various ways, but a common approach is to use an array or circular array with two pointers, one for the next element to be added (the "head" pointer) and one for the next element to be removed (the "tail" pointer). The head pointer moves forward when an element is added to the buffer, while the tail pointer moves forward when an element is removed from the buffer.

Bounded buffers can be used in a wide range of applications where there is a need to transfer data between multiple threads or processes in a synchronized and efficient way. For example, they can be used in networking applications where packets of data need to be transferred between multiple threads or processes, or in audio and video processing applications where samples need to be transferred between threads or processes in real-time.
