# Parallel.Invoke
`Parallel.Invoke` executes an array of Action delegates in parallel and then waits for them to complete. The simplest version of the method is defined as follows:
```c#
public static void Invoke (params Action[] actions);
```
Just as with `PLINQ`, the Parallel.* methods are optimized for compute-bound and not I/O-bound work. However, downloading two web pages at once provides a simple way to demonstrate `Parallel.Invoke`:
```c#
    Parallel.Invoke (
     () => new WebClient().DownloadFile ("http://www.linqpad.net", "lp.html"),
     () => new WebClient().DownloadFile ("http://microsoft.com", "ms.html"));
```
On the surface, this seems like a convenient shortcut for creating and waiting on two thread-bound Task objects. But there’s an` important difference`:
  -  `Parallel .Invoke` still works efficiently if you pass in an array of a million delegates. This is because it `partitions large numbers of elements into batches that it assigns to a handful of underlying Tasks rather than creating a separate Task for each delegate`

For example, if you pass in an array of a million delegates to Parallel.Invoke, it will partition the array into a small number of batches, such as 1000 batches of 1000 delegates each, and assign each batch to a small number of tasks. This allows the actions to be executed in parallel, but without creating an overwhelming number of tasks. The batching strategy is optimized for efficiency, and the number of batches and tasks is determined based on the available system resources and the workload.

Overall, this batching strategy allows Parallel.Invoke to efficiently execute a large number of actions in parallel, without overwhelming the system with too many tasks.

# Thread-unsafe scenario
As with all of Parallel’s methods, you’re on your own when it comes to collating the results. This means that you need to keep thread safety in mind. The following, for instance, is `thread-unsafe`:
```c#
 var data = new List<string>();
    Parallel.Invoke (
() => data.Add (new WebClient().DownloadString ("http://www.foo.com")), () => data.Add (new WebClient().DownloadString ("http://www.far.com")));
```
The code is `thread-unsafe` because the List<T> object data is being accessed concurrently by multiple threads without any synchronization. Since List<T> is not a thread-safe collection, this can result in race conditions, data corruption, or other unexpected behavior. In this specific case, it is possible for one thread to be in the middle of adding an item to the list when another thread tries to modify it, leading to undefined behavior. To make this code thread-safe, you can use a thread-safe collection, such as ConcurrentBag<T>, or add a synchronization mechanism such as a lock to ensure that only one thread can modify the list at a time.
# Solution e.g ConcurrentBag
`Locking` around adding to the list would resolve this, although locking would create a bottleneck if you had a much larger array of quickly executing delegates. A better solution is to use the thread-safe collections, which we cover in later sections— ConcurrentBag would be ideal in this case.

Parallel.Invoke is also overloaded to accept a ParallelOptions object:
```c#
 public static void Invoke (ParallelOptions options,
                               params Action[] actions);
```
With `ParallelOptions`, you can insert a cancellation token, limit the maximum concurrency, and specify a custom task scheduler.
`A cancellation token` is relevant when you’re executing (roughly) more tasks than you have cores: `upon cancellation, any unstarted delegates will be abandoned. Any already executing delegates will, however, continue to completion`
