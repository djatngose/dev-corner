# There are four alternatives
The first is `Channels`, which provides a threadsafe queue that supports asynchronous Read and Write operations. Channels are highly optimized and optionally support dropping some items if a threshold is reached.

The next is `BufferBlock<T>` from TPL Dataflow. If you only have a single consumer, you can use OutputAvailableAsync or ReceiveAsync, or just link it to an ActionBlock<T>. For more information

#  AsyncEx library
`AsyncCollection<T> `is the async near-equivalent of BlockingCollection<T>, capable of wrapping a concurrent producer/consumer collection such as ConcurrentQueue<T> or ConcurrentBag<T>. You can use TakeAsync to asynchronously consume items from the collection 

`AsyncProducerConsumerQueue<T>` is a more portable async-compatible producer/consumer queue. You can use DequeueAsync to asynchronously consume items from the queue.
