# The Parallel Class
PFX provides a basic form of structured parallelism via three static methods in the Parallel class:
`Parallel.Invoke`
Executes an array of delegates in parallel
`Parallel.For`
Performs the parallel equivalent of a C# for loop
`Parallel.ForEach`
Performs the parallel equivalent of a C# foreach loop

`All three methods block until all work is complete.` As with PLINQ, after an unhandled exception, remaining workers are stopped after their current iteration, and the exception (or exceptions) are thrown back to the caller—wrapped in an AggregateException (see “Working with AggregateException” on page 940).
