# ThreadState
You can query a thread's execution status via its ThreadState property. This returns a flags enum of type ThreadState, which combines three “layers” of data in a bitwise fashion. Most values, however, are redundant, unused, or deprecated. The following diagram shows one “layer”:

The following code strips a ThreadState to one of the four most useful values: Unstarted, Running, WaitSleepJoin, and Stopped:
```c#
public static ThreadState SimpleThreadState (ThreadState ts)
{
  return ts & (ThreadState.Unstarted |
               ThreadState.WaitSleepJoin |
               ThreadState.Stopped);
}
```
The ThreadState property is useful for diagnostic purposes, but unsuitable for synchronization, because a thread’s state may change in between testing ThreadState and acting on that information.
