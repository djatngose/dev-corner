# WhenAny
`Task.WhenAny` returns a task that completes when any one of a set of tasks complete. The following completes in one second:
```c#
  Task<int> winningTask = await Task.WhenAny (Delay1(), Delay2(), Delay3());
    Console.WriteLine ("Done");
    Console.WriteLine (winningTask.Result);   // 1

 async Task<int> Delay1() { await Task.Delay (1000); return 1; }
    async Task<int> Delay2() { await Task.Delay (2000); return 2; }
    async Task<int> Delay3() { await Task.Delay (3000); return 3; }

```
Because Task.WhenAny itself returns a task, we await it, which returns the task that finished first. Our example is entirely nonblocking—including the last line when we access the Result property (because winningTask will already have finished). Nonetheless, it’s usually better to await the winningTask:
```c#
Console.WriteLine (await winningTask); // 1
```
because any exceptions are then rethrown without an AggregateException wrap‐
ping. In fact, we can perform both awaits in one step:
```c#
int answer = await await Task.WhenAny (Delay1(), Delay2(), Delay3());
```

# Exception

Task.WhenAny is used to wait for the completion of any of the given tasks. It returns a Task<Task> which represents the task that completed first, whether it completed successfully or with an exception.

If the task that completed first threw an exception, you can access the exception through the Task.Exception property.


```c#
var task1 = Task.Delay(2000);  // Task 1 completes after 2 seconds
var task2 = Task.Delay(1000).ContinueWith(t => throw new Exception("Task 2 failed")); // Task 2 fails after 1 second

var completedTask = await Task.WhenAny(task1, task2);

if (completedTask == task1)
{
 Console.WriteLine("Task 1 completed successfully.");
}
else if (completedTask == task2)
{
 Console.WriteLine("Task 2 failed with the following exception: ");
 Console.WriteLine(completedTask.Exception);
}
```
