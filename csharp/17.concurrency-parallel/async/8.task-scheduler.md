# Task Schedulers
A `task scheduler` allocates tasks to threads and is represented by the abstract Task Scheduler class. .NET provides two concrete implementations: 
  - The `default scheduler` that works in tandem with the `CLR thread pool`
  - The `synchronization context scheduler`
    - It is designed (primarily) to help you with the threading model of WPF and Windows Forms, which requires that user interface elements and controls are accessed only from the thread that created them (see “Threading in Rich Client Applications” on page 621). By capturing it, we can instruct a task or a continuation to execute on this context:

```c#
// Suppose we are on a UI thread in a Windows Forms / WPF application:
 _uiScheduler = TaskScheduler.FromCurrentSynchronizationContext();
```
Assuming Foo is a compute-bound method that returns a string and lblResult is a WPF or Windows Forms label, we could then safely update the label after the operation completes, as follows:
```c#
Task.Run (() => Foo())
.ContinueWith (ant => lblResult.Content = ant.Result, _uiScheduler);
```

Of course, C#’s asynchronous functions would more commonly be used for this kind of thing.
It’s also possible to write our own task scheduler (by subclassing TaskScheduler), although this is something you’d do only in very specialized scenarios. For `custom scheduling`, you’d more commonly use `TaskCompletionSource`.
# How CLR thread scheduler works behind the scene?
The CLR thread scheduler is responsible for managing the execution of threads within a .NET application. It works behind the scenes to distribute threads across available processors in order to maximize throughput and minimize latency.

The thread scheduler is built on top of the operating system's thread scheduler, and it manages a pool of worker threads that are used to execute tasks. When a task is scheduled for execution, the thread scheduler looks for an available worker thread to execute it. If no worker thread is available, the task is queued until a thread becomes available.

The thread scheduler uses a variety of `algorithms` to manage the distribution of tasks across worker threads. For example, it may use a` round-robin approach` to evenly distribute tasks among available threads, or it may use a` priority-based` approach to give higher priority tasks more processing time.

In addition to managing the execution of tasks, the thread scheduler also provides support for synchronization primitives such as locks, semaphores, and events. These primitives are used to coordinate access to shared resources and ensure that threads execute in the correct order.

Overall, the CLR thread scheduler plays a critical role in the performance and reliability of .NET applications by ensuring that threads are efficiently managed and that tasks are executed in a timely and predictable manner.
# Use cases
`Prioritization`: If you have a mix of short- and long-running tasks, you may want to prioritize the short-running tasks so that they complete quickly and don't hold up the longer-running tasks. A custom scheduler can help you prioritize tasks based on their estimated execution time.

`Task grouping`: If you have a large number of tasks to execute, you might want to group them based on their dependencies or other criteria, so that you can execute them more efficiently. A custom scheduler can help you group tasks and execute them in the optimal order.

`Resource allocation`: If your tasks require access to specific resources, such as network or database connections, you may want to limit the number of tasks that can execute concurrently to avoid overloading the resources. A custom scheduler can help you allocate resources and limit the number of concurrent tasks.

`Threading model`: If you're working with a specialized threading model, such as WPF or Windows Forms, you may need a custom scheduler to ensure that tasks are executed on the correct thread.

`Coordinating tasks across multiple machines`: If you have a distributed system that spans multiple machines, you might want to implement a custom task scheduler that can coordinate tasks across the machines. This could involve sending tasks to specific machines based on their capabilities, or ensuring that certain tasks are processed before others.

`Debugging or logging`: If you need to debug or log the execution of tasks in a specific way, you might want to implement a custom task scheduler that captures additional information about each task. This could include details about the thread that executed the task, the time it took to execute, or any exceptions that were thrown.
# Using the default TaskScheduler with Task.Factory:
```c#
Task.Factory.StartNew(() =>
{
    // Do some work
});

```
# Capturing the synchronization context for a WPF or Windows Forms application:
```c#
// Capture the UI synchronization context
TaskScheduler uiScheduler = TaskScheduler.FromCurrentSynchronizationContext();

// Run a task and continue on the UI thread
Task.Run(() => Foo())
    .ContinueWith(ant => lblResult.Content = ant.Result, uiScheduler);

```

# custom TaskScheduler
```c#
public class CustomTaskScheduler : TaskScheduler
{
    // Override the methods of TaskScheduler to provide custom behavior
}

// Use the custom scheduler when creating a task
Task.Factory.StartNew(() =>
{
    // Do some work
}, CancellationToken.None, TaskCreationOptions.None, new CustomTaskScheduler());

```
```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Concurrent;
using System.Collections.Generic;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class SynchronousTaskScheduler : TaskScheduler
{
    // A queue of tasks to be executed.
    private readonly BlockingCollection<Task> _tasks = new BlockingCollection<Task>();

    // The thread that will execute tasks from the queue.
    private readonly Thread _thread;

    public SynchronousTaskScheduler()
    {
        // Create a new thread to execute tasks from the queue.
        _thread = new Thread(() =>
        {
            // Loop until the thread is interrupted.
            while (!_tasks.IsCompleted)
            {
                // Take the next task from the queue.
                var task = _tasks.Take();

                // Execute the task.
                TryExecuteTask(task);
            }
        });

        // Start the thread.
        _thread.Start();
    }

    // Queues a task to be executed by this scheduler.
    protected override void QueueTask(Task task)
    {
        // Add the task to the queue.
        _tasks.Add(task);
    }

    // Attempts to execute the specified task on the current thread.
    protected override bool TryExecuteTaskInline(Task task, bool taskWasPreviouslyQueued)
    {
        // If the current thread is the same as the thread that executes tasks from the queue,
        // and the task was not previously queued, then execute the task synchronously.
        if (Thread.CurrentThread == _thread && !taskWasPreviouslyQueued)
        {
            return TryExecuteTask(task);
        }

        // Otherwise, do not execute the task inline.
        return false;
    }

    // Gets the tasks that are currently queued in this scheduler.
    protected override IEnumerable<Task> GetScheduledTasks()
    {
        return _tasks.ToArray();
    }

    // Signals that no more tasks will be queued to this scheduler.
    public override void Complete()
    {
        // Mark the queue as completed and wait for the thread to finish executing any remaining tasks.
        _tasks.CompleteAdding();
        _thread.Join();
    }
}

```
here is an example usage of this custom TaskScheduler:
```c#
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Create a new task scheduler.
        var scheduler = new SynchronousTaskScheduler();

        // Schedule some tasks on the scheduler.
        Task.Factory.StartNew(() => Console.WriteLine($"Task 1 executing on thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}"), CancellationToken.None, TaskCreationOptions.None, scheduler);
        Task.Factory.StartNew(() => Console.WriteLine($"Task 2 executing on thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}"), CancellationToken.None, TaskCreationOptions.None, scheduler);
        Task.Factory.StartNew(() => Console.WriteLine($"Task 3 executing on thread {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}"), CancellationToken.None, TaskCreationOptions.None, scheduler);

        // Wait for all tasks to complete.
        scheduler.Complete();

        Console.WriteLine("All tasks have completed.");
    }
}

```
