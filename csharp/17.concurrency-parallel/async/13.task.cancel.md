# Cancellation
```c#
class CancellationToken {
      public bool IsCancellationRequested { get; private set; }
      public void Cancel() { IsCancellationRequested = true; }
      public void ThrowIfCancellationRequested()
      {
        if (IsCancellationRequested)
          throw new OperationCanceledException();
} }
```

It’s often important to be able to cancel a concurrent operation after it’s started, perhaps in response to a user request. A simple way to implement this is with a cancellation flag, which we could encapsulate by writing a class like this:
```c#

var cts = new CancellationTokenSource();
CancellationToken token = cts.Token;
cts.CancelAfter(500);
Task task = Task.Factory.StartNew(() =>
{
    Thread.Sleep(1000);
    token.ThrowIfCancellationRequested(); // Check for cancellation request
}, token);
try
{
    task.Wait();
}
catch (AggregateException ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine(ex.InnerException is TaskCanceledException); // True
    Console.WriteLine(task.IsCanceled); // True
    Console.WriteLine(task.Status); // Canceled
}
```
``TaskCanceledException`` is a subclass of `OperationCanceledException`. If you want to explicitly throw an `OperationCanceledException` (rather than calling token.ThrowIfCancellationRequested), you must pass the cancellation token into O`perationCanceledException’s constructor`. If you fail to do this, the task won’t end up with a TaskStatus.Canceled status and won’t trigger OnlyOnCanceled continuations.

# Cancel before running request
If the task is canceled before it has started, it won’t get scheduled—an OperationCan celedException will instead be thrown on the task immediately.

```c#
var cancellationTokenSource = new CancellationTokenSource();
cancellationTokenSource.Cancel();

var task = Task.Run(() =>
{
 Console.WriteLine("This line will never be reached");
}, cancellationTokenSource.Token);

await task;
Console.ReadLine();
// OUTPUT
Unhandled exception. System.Threading.Tasks.TaskCanceledException: A task was canceled.
   at Program.<Main>$(String[] args) in /Users/dat.ngo/working/development/src/develop/dotnet/ConsoleApp1/ConsoleApp1/Program.cs:line 1110
   at Program.<Main>(String[] args)

```
In this example, the cancellationTokenSource.Cancel() method is called before the task is started. As a result, the Task.Run method throws an OperationCanceledException immediately, without ever scheduling the task to run. Therefore, the code inside the task body `(Console.WriteLine("This line will never be reached");) is never executed.`

# cancel multiple request with the same token
If you use the `same cancellation token for multiple operations or tasks`, cancelling the token will propagate to all of them, allowing you to cancel multiple requests or operations simultaneously. This can be useful in scenarios where you want to cancel a group of related operations together, such as cancelling all outstanding requests when a user navigates away from a page in a web application.

Because cancellation tokens are recognized by other APIs, you can pass them into other constructs, and cancellations will propagate seamlessly:
```c#
using System;
using System.Net.Http;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Program
{
    static async Task Main(string[] args)
    {
        // Create a cancellation token source
        var cts = new CancellationTokenSource();

        // Start some HTTP requests using the cancellation token
        var tasks = new[]
        {
            DoHttpGet("https://example.com", cts.Token),
            DoHttpGet("https://example.org", cts.Token),
            DoHttpGet("https://example.net", cts.Token)
        };

        // Wait for all the tasks to complete, or for the cancellation token to be cancelled
        try
        {
            await Task.WhenAll(tasks);
        }
        catch (OperationCanceledException)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Requests were cancelled");
        }

        Console.WriteLine("Press any key to exit...");
        Console.ReadKey();
    }

    static async Task DoHttpGet(string url, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
        using var client = new HttpClient();

        // Make an HTTP GET request, passing the cancellation token
        var response = await client.GetAsync(url, cancellationToken);

        // Check the response status code and content
        response.EnsureSuccessStatusCode();
        var content = await response.Content.ReadAsStringAsync();
        Console.WriteLine($"Received content from {url}: {content}");
    }
}

```
In this example, we create a cancellation token source cts and use it to start three HTTP GET requests in parallel, each of which calls the DoHttpGet method and passes the cancellation token cts.Token.

If the cts token is cancelled before the requests complete, the Task.WhenAll method will throw an OperationCanceledException, which we catch and handle by printing a message to the console.

By passing the same cancellation token to each HTTP request, we ensure that if the token is cancelled, all the requests will be cancelled as well.


We could then write a cancellable asynchronous method as follows:
```c#
async Task Foo (CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
 for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  Console.WriteLine (i);
  await Task.Delay (1000);
  cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();
 } 
}

await Foo(new CancellationToken(true));
```
When the caller wants to cancel, it calls Cancel on the cancellation token that it passed into Foo. This sets IsCancellationRequested to true, which causes Foo to fault a short time later with an `OperationCanceledException` (a predefined exception in the System namespace designed for this purpose).

Thread-safety aside (we should be locking around reading/writing IsCancellation Requested), this pattern is effective, and the CLR provides a type called Cancella tionToken that is very similar to what we’ve just shown. However, it lacks a Cancel method; this method is instead exposed on another type called CancellationToken Source. This separation provides some security: a method that has access only to a CancellationToken object can check for but not initiate cancellation.
To get a cancellation token, we first instantiate a CancellationTokenSource: var cancelSource = new CancellationTokenSource();
This exposes a Token property, which returns a CancellationToken. Hence, we could call our Foo method, as follows:
```c#
    var cancelSource = new CancellationTokenSource();
    Task foo = Foo (cancelSource.Token);
    ... (sometime later) cancelSource.Cancel();
```
Most asynchronous methods in the CLR support cancellation tokens, including Delay. If we modify Foo such that it passes its token into the Delay method, the task will end immediately upon request (rather than up to a second later):
```c#
async Task Foo (CancellationToken cancellationToken)
    {
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
        Console.WriteLine (i);
await Task.Delay (1000, cancellationToken); }
}
```

Notice that we no longer need to call ThrowIfCancellationRequested because Task.Delay is doing that for us. Cancellation tokens propagate nicely down the call stack (just as cancellation requests cascade up the call stack, by virtue of being exceptions).

Synchronous methods can support cancellation, too (such as Task’s Wait method). In such cases, the instruction to cancel will need to come asynchronously (e.g., from another task). For example:
```c#
    var cancelSource = new CancellationTokenSource();
    Task.Delay (5000).ContinueWith (ant => cancelSource.Cancel());
    ```

In fact, you can specify a time interval when constructing CancellationToken Source to initiate cancellation after a set period of time (just as we demonstrated). It’s useful for implementing timeouts, whether synchronous or asynchronous:
```c#
var cancelSource = new CancellationTokenSource (5000);
try { await Foo (cancelSource.Token); }
catch (OperationCanceledException ex) { Console.WriteLine ("Cancelled"); }
```

# Example
```c#
async Task Foo (CancellationToken cancellationToken)
{
 for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++) {
  Console.WriteLine (i);
  await Task.Delay (1000);
  cancellationToken.ThrowIfCancellationRequested();
 } 
}

var cancelSource = new CancellationTokenSource (5000);
try { await Foo (cancelSource.Token); }
catch (OperationCanceledException ex) { Console.WriteLine ("Cancelled"); }
```

# Use cases
`Long-running operations`: If you have a long-running operation, such as a file download or a database query, you might want to provide the user with the ability to cancel the operation if it's taking too long. In this case, you could use a CancellationToken to allow the user to cancel the operation at any time.

`User interactions`: If you have an application that requires user input or interactions, you might want to provide the user with the ability to cancel a particular action or operation. For example, if the user is filling out a form and decides they no longer want to complete it, you could use a CancellationToken to cancel the operation and prevent any further processing.

`Resource management`: If your application is using limited resources, such as memory or network bandwidth, you might want to provide the ability to cancel operations that are using too much of those resources. In this case, you could use a CancellationToken to stop the operation before it consumes too much of the limited resource.
