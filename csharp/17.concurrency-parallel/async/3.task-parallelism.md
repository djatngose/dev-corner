# Task Parallelism
Task parallelism is the lowest-level approach to parallelization with PFX. The classes for working at this level are defined in the System.Threading.Tasks namespace and comprise the following:
- `Task`: for managing a unit of work
- `Task<TResult>`: For managing a unit for work with a return value
- `TaskFactory`: For creating tasks
- `TaskFactory<TResult>`: For creating tasks and continuations with the same return type
- `TaskScheduler`: For managing the scheduling of tasks
- `TaskCompletionSource`: For manually controlling a task’s workflow

The `Task Parallel Library` lets you create `hundreds (or even thousands) of tasks with minimal overhead`. But if you want to create `millions of tasks`, you’ll need to `partition` those tasks into larger work units to maintain efficiency. The `Parallel class and PLINQ` do this automatically.
