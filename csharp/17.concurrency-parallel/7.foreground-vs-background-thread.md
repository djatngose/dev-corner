# Foreground Versus Background Threads
`By default, threads you create explicitly are foreground threads`.
`Foreground threads keep the application alive for as long as any one of them is running, whereas background threads do not.`

After all foreground threads finish, the application ends, and any background threads still running abruptly terminate.

A thread’s foreground/background status has no relation to its priority (allocation of execution time).

You can query or change a thread’s background status using its IsBackground property:
```c#
    static void Main (string[] args)
    {
      Thread worker = new Thread ( () => Console.ReadLine() );
      if (args.Length > 0) worker.IsBackground = true;
      worker.Start();
}
```
If this program is called with
  -  `no arguments`, `the worker thread assumes foreground status and will wait on the ReadLine statement for the user to press Enter. Meanwhile, the main thread exits, but the application keeps running because a foreground thread is still alive`. 
  - `On the other hand, if an argument is passed to Main(), the worker is assigned background status, and the program exits almost immediately as the main thread ends (terminating the ReadLine).`

When a process terminates abruptly, such as when the user closes the application or the application crashes, `any finally blocks in the execution stack of background threads may not be executed`. This can lead to cleanup work, such as deleting temporary files, not being performed. To avoid this,
  - you can explicitly wait for background threads to finish before exiting the application. `This can be done by joining the thread or using a signaling construct`. It's important to specify a `timeout` in case the thread does not finish, so that the application does not hang indefinitely.
  - If you’ve created the thread yourself, call Join on the thread.
  - If you’re on a `pooled thread`, use an `event wait handle.`

For example, if your application starts a background thread to perform some work, you can wait for the thread to finish before exiting the application:

```c#
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    Thread backgroundThread = new Thread(DoWork);
    backgroundThread.Start();

    // Wait for the background thread to finish
    if (!backgroundThread.Join(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10)))
    {
        // The thread did not finish within 10 seconds
        // Log an error or display a message to the user
    }

    // Exit the application
    Environment.Exit(0);
}

static void DoWork()
{
    // Perform some work
    // ...

    // Clean up resources
    // ...
}

```
In either case, you should specify a timeout, so you can abandon a renegade thread should it refuse to finish for some reason. This is your backup exit strategy: in the end, you want your application to close — without the user having to enlist help from the Task Manager!

`NOTE`: If a user uses the `Task Manager` to forcibly end a .NET process, all threads `“drop dead”` as though they were `background threads`. This is observed rather than documented behavior, and it could vary depending on the CLR and operating system version.

`Foreground threads `don’t require this treatment, but you must take care to avoid bugs that could cause the thread not to end. A common cause for applications failing to exit properly is the presence of active foreground threads.
