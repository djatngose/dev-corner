# Threading
A thread is an execution path that can proceed independently of others.
Each thread runs within an operating system process, which provides an isolated environment in which a program runs. With a single-threaded program, just one thread runs in the process’s isolated environment, and so that thread has exclusive access to it. With a multithreaded program, multiple threads run in a single process, sharing the same execution environment (memory, in particular). This, in part, is why multithreading is useful: one thread can fetch data in the background, for instance, while another thread displays the data as it arrives. This data is referred to as shared state.
# How Threading Works
`Multithreading` is managed internally by a thread scheduler, a function the CLR typically delegates to the operating system. A thread scheduler ensures all active threads are allocated appropriate execution time, and that threads that are waiting or blocked (for instance, on an exclusive lock or on user input)  do not consume CPU time.

On a `single-processor` computer, a thread scheduler performs time-slicing — rapidly switching execution between each of the active threads. Under Windows, a time-slice is typically in the tens-of-milliseconds region — much larger than the CPU overhead in actually switching context between one thread and another (which is typically in the few-microseconds region).

On a `multi-processor `computer, multithreading is implemented with a mixture of time-slicing and genuine concurrency, where different threads run code simultaneously on different CPUs. It’s almost certain there will still be some time-slicing, because of the operating system’s need to service its own threads — as well as those of other applications.

A thread is said to be `preempted` when its execution is interrupted due to an external factor such as time-slicing. In most situations, a thread has no control over when and where it’s preempted.

# Creating a Thread
A client program (Console, WPF, UWP, or Windows Forms) starts in a single thread that’s created automatically by the OS (the “main” thread). Here it lives out its life as a single-threaded application, unless you do otherwise, by creating more threads (directly or indirectly).

You can create and start a new thread by instantiating a Thread object and calling its Start method. The simplest constructor for Thread takes a ThreadStart delegate: a parameterless method indicating where execution should begin. Here’s an example:

```c#
    // NB: All samples in this chapter assume the following namespace imports:
    using System;
    using System.Threading;
    Thread t = new Thread (WriteY);          // Kick off a new thread
    t.Start();                               // running WriteY()
    // Simultaneously, do something on the main thread.
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) Console.Write ("x");
    void WriteY()
    {
for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) Console.Write ("y"); }
// OUTOUT: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxyyyyyyyxyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyxxyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
```

The main thread creates a new thread t on which it runs a method that repeat‐ edly prints the character y. Simultaneously, the main thread repeatedly prints the character x, as shown in Figure 14-1. On a single-core computer, the operating system must allocate “slices” of time to each thread (typically 20 ms in Windows) to simulate concurrency, resulting in repeated blocks of x and y. On a multicore or multiprocessor machine, the two threads can genuinely execute in parallel (subject to competition by other active processes on the computer), although you still get repeated blocks of x and y in this example because of subtleties in the mechanism by which Console handles concurrent requests.

# Join and Sleep

You can wait for another thread to end by calling its Join method:
```c#
    Thread t = new Thread (Go);
    t.Start();
    t.Join();
    Console.WriteLine ("Thread t has ended!");
    void Go() { for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) Console.Write ("y"); }
```
This prints “y” 1,000 times, followed by “Thread t has ended!” immediately after‐ ward. You can include a `timeout when calling Join, either in milliseconds or as a TimeSpan`. It then `returns true if the thread ended or false if it timed out.`
Thread.Sleep pauses the current thread for a specified period: Thread.Sleep (TimeSpan.FromHours (1)); // Sleep for 1 hour
    Thread.Sleep (500);                     // Sleep for 500 milliseconds

# Thread.Sleep vs Threa.Yield
Use cases for `Thread.Yield()`:

A thread that is waiting for a lock on a shared resource, but doesn't want to block the CPU while it waits. By calling Thread.Yield(), the thread can give other threads running on the same processor a chance to execute, while still remaining in the scheduling queue and waiting for the lock to become available.
A thread that is doing a lot of computational work, but periodically needs to check for external events (such as user input or network activity). By calling Thread.Yield() periodically, the thread can give other threads a chance to execute, while still making progress on its computation.

Use cases for `Thread.Sleep(0):`

A real-time application that needs to respond to events in a timely manner. By calling Thread.Sleep(0) periodically, the application can give other threads in the system a chance to execute, which can help ensure that event handlers are processed promptly and without delay.
A multi-threaded application that needs to process large volumes of data. By calling Thread.Sleep(0) periodically, the application can ensure that all threads in the system get a chance to execute, which can help prevent thread starvation and ensure that all available processing resources are being used efficiently.

Note: `Sleep(0) or Yield` is occasionally useful in production code for advanced performance tweaks. It’s also an excellent diag‐ nostic tool for helping to uncover thread safety issues: if inserting Thread.Yield() anywhere in your code breaks the program, you almost certainly have a bug.
While waiting on a Sleep or Join, a thread is blocked.

# why calling Thread.Yield() or Thread.Sleep(0) too frequently can lead to decreased performance and may even cause deadlock or other synchronization problems in some cases.

`Calling Thread.Yield() or Thread.Sleep(0)` too frequently can lead to decreased performance and may cause deadlock or other synchronization problems for several reasons:

`Increased context switching: `When a thread calls Thread.Yield() or Thread.Sleep(0), it gives up its current time slice and allows another thread to run. If this happens too frequently, the operating system's scheduler may spend more time switching between threads than actually running them, which can lead to decreased performance.

`Starvation`: If a thread calls Thread.Yield() or Thread.Sleep(0) too frequently, it may not get enough CPU time to complete its work. This can lead to starvation, where the thread is continually preempted and never gets a chance to run for long enough to complete its work.

`Synchronization problems:` If multiple threads are accessing shared resources, calling Thread.Yield() or Thread.Sleep(0) too frequently can cause synchronization problems. For example, if two threads are both waiting for a resource to become available, calling Thread.Yield() or Thread.Sleep(0) too frequently may cause one thread to continually yield its time slice, allowing the other thread to repeatedly acquire the resource, leading to a deadlock.

In general, it's best to let the operating system's scheduler manage thread scheduling and use synchronization primitives like locks and semaphores to coordinate access to shared resources. Thread.Yield() and Thread.Sleep(0) should be used sparingly and only when necessary, as they can lead to unpredictable behavior and may actually decrease performance in some cases.

# Naming Threads
Each thread has a Name property that you can set for the benefit of debugging. This is particularly useful in Visual Studio, since the thread’s name is displayed in the Threads Window and Debug Location toolbar. You can set a thread’s name just once; attempts to change it later will throw an exception.

The static Thread.CurrentThread property gives you the currently executing thread. In the following example, we set the main thread’s name:
```c#
class ThreadNaming
{
  static void Main()
  {
    Thread.CurrentThread.Name = "main";
    Thread worker = new Thread (Go);
    worker.Name = "worker";
    worker.Start();
    Go();
  }
 
  static void Go()
  {
    Console.WriteLine ("Hello from " + Thread.CurrentThread.Name);
  }
}
```
