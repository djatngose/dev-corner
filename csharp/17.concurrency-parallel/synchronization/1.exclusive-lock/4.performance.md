# Performance
`Locking is fast`: you can expect to acquire and release a lock in less than `20 nanoseconds` on a 2020-era computer if the lock is uncontended. If it is contended, the consequential context switch moves the overhead closer to the microsecond region, although it can be longer before the thread is actually rescheduled.

# does use lock impact the performance from a huge of request? is there any better solution?
Using locks can impact the performance in a multi-threaded environment, especially if there are a large number of requests. This is because locks can cause contention, `where multiple threads are competing for access to the same lock, leading to a bottleneck and decreased performance`.

One possible solution to improve performance in such scenarios is to use `lock-free data structures or algorithms`. These are designed to allow concurrent access without the use of locks, by using atomic operations or other synchronization mechanisms. For example, the .NET framework provides several lock-free collections such as `ConcurrentDictionary and ConcurrentQueue that are optimized for high concurrency scenarios.`

Another approach is to use a technique called `"thread pooling"` where instead of creating a new thread for each request, a fixed set of threads are used to handle multiple requests. This can help reduce the overhead of thread creation and context switching. `In .NET, you can use the ThreadPool class to create a thread pool and schedule tasks.`

It's important to note that there is no one-size-fits-all solution for improving performance in multi-threaded scenarios, and the best approach will depend on the specific requirements of the application.
