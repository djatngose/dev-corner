# Locking
Exclusive locking is used to ensure that only one thread can enter particular sections of code at a time. The two main exclusive locking constructs are `lock` and `Mutex`. Of the two, the lock construct is faster and more convenient. `Mutex`, though, has a niche in that its `lock` can span applications in different processes on the computer.

Only one thread can lock the synchronizing object (in this case, _locker) at a time, and any contending threads are blocked until the lock is released. `If more than one thread contends the lock, they are queued on a “ready queue” and granted the lock on a first-come, first-served basis `(a caveat is that nuances in the behavior of Windows and the CLR mean that the fairness of the queue can sometimes be violated)

A thread blocked while awaiting a contended lock has a ThreadState of WaitSleepJoin. In Interrupt and Abort, we describe how a blocked thread can be forcibly released via another thread. This is a fairly heavy-duty technique that might be used in ending a thread.

# A Comparison of Locking Constructs

Construct	Purpose	Cross-process?	`Overhead`*
`lock` (Monitor.Enter / Monitor.Exit)	Ensures just one thread can access a resource, or section of code at a time	-	`20ns`
`Mutex`	Yes	`1000ns`
`SemaphoreSlim` (introduced in Framework 4.0)	Ensures not more than a specified number of concurrent threads can access a resource, or section of code	-	`200ns`
`Semaphore`	Yes	1000ns
`ReaderWriterLockSlim` (introduced in Framework 3.5)	Allows multiple readers to coexist with a single writer	-	`40ns`
`ReaderWriterLock` (effectively deprecated)	-	`100ns`

* Time taken to lock and unlock the construct once on the same thread (assuming no blocking), as measured on an Intel Core i7 860.

# Exclusive Locking
There are three exclusive locking constructs: the lock statement, Mutex, and SpinLock. The lock construct is the most convenient and widely used, whereas the other two target niche scenarios:
- `Lock`
- `Mutex` lets you span multiple processes (computer-wide locks).
- `SpinLock` implements a micro-optimization that can lessen context switches in
high-concurrency scenarios

# The lock Statement
To illustrate the need for locking, consider the following class:
```c#
class ThreadUnsafe
{
      static int _val1 = 1, _val2 = 1;
      static void Go()
      {
        if (_val2 != 0) Console.WriteLine (_val1 / _val2);
        _val2 = 0; 
      }
}
```
This class is not thread-safe: if Go were called by two threads simultaneously, it would be possible to get a division-by-zero error because _val2 could be set to zero in one thread right as the other thread was in between executing the if statement and Console.WriteLine. Here’s how lock fixes the problem:
```c#
class ThreadSafe
{
    static readonly object _locker = new object(); static int _val1 = 1, _val2 = 1;
    static void Go() {
        lock (_locker)
        {
          if (_val2 != 0) Console.WriteLine (_val1 / _val2);
          _val2 = 0;
        }
   }
}
```
`Only one thread can lock the synchronizing object (in this case, _locker) at a time`, and any contending threads are blocked until the lock is released. 

If more than one thread contends the lock, they are queued on a `“ready queue”` and granted the lock on a first-come, first-served basis.1 Exclusive locks are sometimes said to enforce serialized access to whatever’s protected by the lock because one thread’s access cannot overlap with that of another. In this case, we’re protecting the logic inside the Go method as well as the fields _val1 and _val2.

# Monitor.Enter and Monitor.Exit
C#’s lock statement is in fact a syntactic shortcut for a call to the methods Moni tor.Enter and Monitor.Exit, with a try/finally block. Here’s (a simplified ver‐ sion of ) what’s actually happening within the Go method of the preceding example:
```c#
 Monitor.Enter (_locker);
try {
      if (_val2 != 0) Console.WriteLine (_val1 / _val2);
      _val2 = 0;
}
finally { Monitor.Exit (_locker); }

```
Calling Monitor.Exit without first calling Monitor.Enter on the same object throws an exception.

# The lockTaken overloads
The code that we just demonstrated has a subtle vulnerability. Consider the (unlikely) event of an exception being thrown between the call to `Monitor.Enter` and the try block (due, perhaps, to an OutOfMemoryException or, in .NET Frame‐ work, if the thread is aborted). In such a scenario, the lock might or might not be taken. If the lock is taken, it won’t be released—because we’ll never enter the try/finally block. This will result in a `leaked lock`. To avoid this danger, Monitor.Enter defines the following overload:
```c#
public static void Enter (object obj, ref bool lockTaken);
```
`lockTaken` is false after this method if (and only if) the Enter method throws an exception and the lock was not taken.
`Here’s the more robust pattern of use (which is exactly how C# translates a lock statement):`
```c#
    bool lockTaken = false;
try {
    Monitor.Enter (_locker, ref lockTaken);
      // Do your stuff...
    }
finally 
{
   if (lockTaken) Monitor.Exit (_locker);
}
```

This passage explains the potential vulnerability of using Monitor.Enter without handling exceptions properly. When a thread enters a Monitor, it needs to release the lock before exiting to allow other threads to acquire the lock. However, if an exception is thrown after acquiring the lock, the lock might not be released properly, resulting in a "leaked" lock that prevents other threads from acquiring the lock and potentially causing deadlocks.

To avoid this issue, Monitor.Enter provides an overload that takes a ref bool lockTaken parameter, which indicates whether the lock was taken successfully. By passing false to this parameter initially, the caller can determine whether the lock was taken after the Monitor.Enter method returns. If an exception is thrown and the lock was not taken, the lockTaken parameter remains false, indicating that the lock was not taken and there is no need to release it.

The passage also provides a more robust pattern for using Monitor.Enter and Monitor.Exit with exception handling using a try-finally block. The `lockTaken` variable is used to keep track of whether the lock was taken successfully, and if so, to ensure that it is released properly in the finally block. This pattern is also used by the lock statement in C#.

# TryEnter
Monitor also provides a `TryEnter method that allows a timeout to be specified, either in milliseconds or as a TimeSpan`. The method then returns true if a lock was obtained, or false if no lock was obtained because the method timed out. TryEnter can also be called with no argument, which “tests” the lock, timing out immediately if the lock can’t be obtained immediately. As with the Enter method, TryEnter is overloaded to accept a lockTaken argument.

# Choosing the Synchronization Object
You can `use any object visible to each of the partaking threads as a synchronizing object, subject to one hard rule: it must be a reference type`. The synchronizing object is typically private (because this helps to encapsulate the locking logic) and is typically an instance or static field. The synchronizing object can double as the object it’s protecting, as the _list field does in the following example:
```c#
class ThreadSafe
    {
      List <string> _list = new List <string>();
      void Test() {
        lock (_list)
        {
          _list.Add ("Item 1");
          ...
```

A field dedicated for the purpose of locking (such as _locker, in the example prior) allows precise control over the scope and granularity of the lock. You can also use the containing object (this) as a synchronization object:
```c#
    lock (this) { ... }
```
Or even its type:
```c#
    lock (typeof (Widget)) { ... }    // For protecting access to statics
```
The `disadvantage of locking in this way is that you’re not encapsulating the locking logic, so it becomes more difficult to prevent deadlocking and excessive blocking.`
You can also lock on local variables captured by lambda expressions or anonymous methods.

# When to Lock
As a basic rule, you need to lock around accessing `any writable shared field`. Even in the simplest case—an assignment operation on a single field—you must consider synchronization. In the following class, neither the Increment nor the Assign method is thread-safe:
```c#
  class ThreadUnsafe
  {
      static int _x;
      static void Increment() { _x++; }
      static void Assign()    { _x = 123; }
  }

```
Here are thread-safe versions of Increment and Assign:
```c#
    static readonly object _locker = new object();
    static int _x;
    static void Increment() { lock (_locker) _x++; }
    static void Assign() { lock (_locker) _x = 123; }
```

`Without locks, two problems can arise`:
• Operations such as `incrementing a variable (or even reading/writing a variable, under certain conditions) are not atomic`.
• The compiler, CLR, and processor are entitled to reorder instructions and `cache variables in CPU registers to improve performance`—as long as such optimizations don’t change the behavior of a single-threaded program (or a multithreaded program that uses locks).

`Locking` mitigates the second problem because it creates a `memory barrier` before and after the lock. A memory barrier is a `“fence”` through which the effects of reordering and caching cannot penetrate.

# Locking and Atomicity
If a group of variables are always read and written within the same lock, you can say that the variables are read and written atomically. Let’s suppose that fields x and y are always read and assigned within a lock on object locker:
```c#
    lock (locker) { if (x != 0) y /= x; }
```
We can say that x and y are accessed atomically because the code block cannot be divided or preempted by the actions of another thread in such a way that it will change x or y and invalidate its outcome. You’ll never get a division-by-zero error, provided that x and y are always accessed within this same exclusive lock.

The atomicity provided by a lock is violated if an exception is thrown within a lock block (whether or not multithreading is involved). For example, consider the following:
```c#
decimal _savingsBalance, _checkBalance;
void Transfer (decimal amount) {
lock (_locker) {
_savingsBalance += amount;
_checkBalance -= amount + GetBankFee(); }
}
```
If an exception were thrown by GetBankFee(), the bank would lose money. In this case, we could avoid the problem by calling GetBankFee earlier. A solution for more complex cases is to implement “rollback” logic within a catch or finally block.
