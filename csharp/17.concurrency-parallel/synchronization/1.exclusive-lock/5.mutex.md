# Mutex
A `Mutex` is like a C# lock, but it can `work across multiple processes`. In other words, Mutex can be c`omputer-wide as well as application-wide`. Acquiring and releasing an uncontended Mutex takes around `half a microsecond—more than 20 times slower than a lock.`

With a `Mutex` class, you call the `WaitOne` method to lock and ReleaseMutex to unlock. Just as with the lock statement, a Mutex can be released only from the same thread that obtained it.

`Note`: If you forget to call ReleaseMutex and simply call Close or Dispose, an AbandonedMutexException will be thrown upon anyone else waiting upon that mutex.

A common use for a cross-process Mutex is to ensure that only one instance of a program can run at a time. Here’s how it’s done:
```c#
// Naming a Mutex makes it available computer-wide. Use a name that's
// unique to your company and application (e.g., include your URL).
using var mutex = new Mutex (true, @"Global\oreilly.com OneAtATimeDemo");
// Wait a few seconds if contended, in case another instance
// of the program is still in the process of shutting down.
if (!mutex.WaitOne (TimeSpan.FromSeconds (3), false))
{
    Console.WriteLine ("Another instance of the app is running. Bye!");
    return; 
}
try { RunProgram(); }
finally { mutex.ReleaseMutex (); }

void RunProgram()
{
      Console.WriteLine ("Running. Press Enter to exit");
      Console.ReadLine();
}
```
if you’re running under Terminal Services or in separate Unix consoles, a computer-wide Mutex is ordinarily visible only to applications in the same session. To make it visible to all ter‐ minal server sessions, prefix its name with Global\, as shown in the example.

# what different mutext and lock?

Both `mutex` and `lock` are synchronization mechanisms that are used to control access to shared resources among multiple threads. However, they differ in the following ways:

`Ownership`: A mutex is owned by the thread that first acquires it and can be released only by that thread, whereas a lock is owned by the thread that currently holds it and can be released by any thread.
```c#
// Lock example
object lockObject = new object();
lock (lockObject)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Thread acquired lock");
    // Perform some work
}
// Lock is released here

// Mutex example
Mutex mutexObject = new Mutex();
try
{
    mutexObject.WaitOne();
    Console.WriteLine("Thread acquired mutex");
    // Perform some work
}
finally
{
    mutexObject.ReleaseMutex();
}
// Mutex is released here

```
In the lock example, the thread that acquires the lock is the only one that can release it. In the mutex example, any thread that acquires the mutex can release it, but only after acquiring it first.

`Scoping`: A mutex can be shared across multiple processes, whereas a lock is only valid within a single process.
```c#
// Lock example
public class MyThreadSafeClass
{
    private readonly object lockObject = new object();

    public void MyThreadSafeMethod()
    {
        lock (lockObject)
        {
            // Perform some thread-safe work
        }
    }
}

// Mutex example
public class MyThreadSafeClass
{
    private readonly Mutex mutexObject = new Mutex();

    public void MyThreadSafeMethod()
    {
        try
        {
            mutexObject.WaitOne();
            // Perform some thread-safe work
        }
        finally
        {
            mutexObject.ReleaseMutex();
        }
    }
}

```
In both examples, the thread-safe method is protected by a synchronization mechanism. However, in the lock example, the lock is only valid within the context of the MyThreadSafeClass instance, while in the mutex example, the mutex can be shared across multiple instances of the class or even different processes.


`Wait time`: When a thread tries to acquire a mutex that is currently held by another thread, it can optionally wait for a specified period for the mutex to become available. In contrast, when a thread tries to acquire a lock that is currently held by another thread, it must wait indefinitely until the lock becomes available.
```c#
// Lock example
object lockObject = new object();
lock (lockObject)
{
    // Do some work
    Monitor.Wait(lockObject, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1)); // Wait for 1 second
    // Do some more work
}
// Lock is released here

// Mutex example
Mutex mutexObject = new Mutex();
try
{
    mutexObject.WaitOne(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(1)); // Wait for 1 second
    // Perform some work
}
finally
{
    mutexObject.ReleaseMutex();
}
// Mutex is released here

```
In the lock example, when a thread tries to acquire a lock that is already held by another thread, it can wait for a specified period for the lock to become available using the Monitor.Wait method. In the mutex example, a similar functionality can be achieved by passing a timeout value to the WaitOne method.

`Performance`: Acquiring and releasing a mutex can be more expensive than using a lock, as it involves kernel-level calls and context switches. Therefore, a lock is generally preferred for short critical sections, while a mutex may be more suitable for longer or cross-process synchronization.

In general, a `lock` is simpler and more lightweight than a mutex, but a `mutex` provides more advanced features and can be used for more complex synchronization scenarios. It's important to choose the appropriate synchronization mechanism based on the specific requirements of your application.
