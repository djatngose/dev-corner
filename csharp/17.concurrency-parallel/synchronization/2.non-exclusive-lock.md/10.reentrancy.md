# Reentrancy
A thread-safe method is sometimes called `reentrant`, because it can be preempted part way through its execution, and then called again on another thread without ill effect. In a general sense, the terms thread-safe and reentrant are considered either synonymous or closely related.

Reentrancy, however, has another more sinister connotation in automatic locking regimes. If the Synchronization attribute is applied with the reentrant argument true:
```c#
[Synchronization(true)]
```
then the synchronization context's lock will be temporarily released when execution leaves the context. In the previous example, this would prevent the deadlock from occurring; obviously desirable. However, a side effect is that during this interim, any thread is free to call any method on the original object ("re-entering" the synchronization context) and unleashing the very complications of multithreading one is trying to avoid in the first place. This is the problem of reentrancy.
`Note`: Because [Synchronization(true)] is applied at a class-level, this attribute turns every out-of-context method call made by the class into a Trojan for reentrancy.

While `reentrancy` can be dangerous, there are sometimes few other options. For instance, suppose one was to implement multithreading internally within a synchronized class, by delegating the logic to workers running objects in separate contexts. These workers may be unreasonably hindered in communicating with each other or the original object without reentrancy.

This highlights a fundamental weakness with automatic synchronization: the extensive scope over which locking is applied can actually manufacture difficulties that may never have otherwise arisen. These difficulties — deadlocking, reentrancy, and emasculated concurrency — can make manual locking more palatable in anything other than simple scenarios.

Certainly! Let's consider an example to demonstrate how reentrancy works with the [Synchronization(true)] attribute in a multithreading scenario.

Suppose we have a class called Calculator that performs arithmetic operations. We want to ensure that the methods of the Calculator class are thread-safe, so we apply the [Synchronization(true)] attribute at the class-level, indicating that reentrant synchronization should be enabled.

Here's an example implementation in C#:

csharp
Copy code
[Synchronization(true)]
class Calculator
{
    public void Add(int x, int y)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Start of Add method");
        // Perform some calculations
        int result = x + y;
        Console.WriteLine($"Result: {result}");
        // Simulate a delay
        Thread.Sleep(2000);
        Console.WriteLine("End of Add method");
    }
}
In this example, the Add method of the Calculator class performs an addition operation and introduces a delay of 2 seconds using Thread.Sleep(2000) to simulate a time-consuming calculation.

Now, let's consider two threads, Thread A and Thread B, calling the Add method simultaneously:

Thread A:

csharp
Copy code
calculator.Add(3, 5);
Thread B:

csharp
Copy code
calculator.Add(10, 20);
With the [Synchronization(true)] attribute applied, the reentrant behavior allows Thread B to call the Add method while Thread A is still executing it. When Thread B enters the Add method, the synchronization context's lock is temporarily released, and Thread B is allowed to proceed with its calculations.

However, this reentrant behavior also means that Thread B can potentially call any other method of the Calculator class while Thread A is in the middle of its execution. This can lead to unexpected interactions and potential issues, as different threads may modify the object's state concurrently.

For example, if we introduce a new method Multiply in the Calculator class:

csharp
Copy code
public void Multiply(int x, int y)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Start of Multiply method");
    // Perform some calculations
    int result = x * y;
    Console.WriteLine($"Result: {result}");
    Console.WriteLine("End of Multiply method");
}
Now, consider the following scenario:

Thread A:

csharp
Copy code
calculator.Add(3, 5);
Thread B:

csharp
Copy code
calculator.Multiply(2, 4);
In this case, Thread B calls the Multiply method while Thread A is still executing the Add method. Since reentrancy is enabled, Thread B can freely enter the Multiply method while the lock is temporarily released. This simultaneous execution of methods from different threads may lead to unexpected results or conflicts, depending on the specific implementation and shared state within the Calculator class.

It's important to note that while reentrancy can be useful in certain scenarios, it also introduces the risk of potential issues and requires careful consideration of thread safety and synchronization to avoid unexpected behavior or data corruption.
