# Thread-Local Storage
Much of this chapter has focused on synchronization constructs and the issues aris‐ ing from having threads concurrently access the same data. Sometimes, however, you want to keep data isolated, ensuring that each thread has a separate copy. Local variables achieve exactly this, but they are useful only with transient data.

The solution is `thread-local storage`. You might be hard-pressed to think of a require‐ ment: data you’d want to keep isolated to a thread tends to be transient by nature. Its main application is for storing “out-of-band” data—that which supports the execution path’s infrastructure, such as messaging, transaction, and security tokens. Passing such data around in method parameters can be clumsy and can alienate all but your own methods; storing such information in ordinary static fields means sharing it among all threads.

`TLS` is implemented in .NET through the `ThreadLocal<T> class`, which allows you to allocate a separate instance of an object for each thread that accesses it. When a thread accesses the object, it gets its own copy of the object, which it can modify without affecting other threads.

`Thread-local storage` can also be useful in optimizing parallel code. It allows each thread to exclusively access its own version of a thread-unsafe object without needing locks—and without needing to reconstruct that object between method calls.
There are four ways to implement` thread-local storage`. We take a look at them in the following subsections.

`Thread-Local Storage (TLS)` is used when you need to store and access data that is unique to a particular thread. This can be useful in multithreaded applications where different threads need access to thread-specific data.

`Note`: thread-local storage can also be useful in `optimizing parallel code`. It allows each thread to exclusively access its own version of a thread-unsafe object without needing locks — and without needing to reconstruct that object between method call

One `caveat` with TLS is that it can lead to `increased memory usage`, since each thread gets its own independent copy of the data. Therefore, it is important to use TLS judiciously and only when it is necessary to avoid conflicts or synchronization issues.

```c#

ThreadLocal<Expensive> _threadLocal = new ThreadLocal<Expensive>(() => new Expensive());

Console.WriteLine($"Initial value: {_threadLocal.Value.Value}");
        
var thread1 = new Thread(() => {
 Console.WriteLine($"Thread 1: {_threadLocal.Value.Value}");
 _threadLocal.Value.Value = 20;
 Console.WriteLine($"Thread 1: {_threadLocal.Value.Value}");
});
        
var thread2 = new Thread(() => {
 Console.WriteLine($"Thread 2: {_threadLocal.Value.Value}");
 _threadLocal.Value.Value = 30;
 Console.WriteLine($"Thread 2: {_threadLocal.Value.Value}");
});
        
thread1.Start();
thread2.Start();
        
thread1.Join();
thread2.Join();
        
Console.WriteLine($"Final value: {_threadLocal.Value.Value}");
Console.ReadLine();

class Expensive
{
 public int Value { get; set; } = 10;
}

//OUTPUT
Initial value: 10
Thread 1: 10
Thread 1: 20
Thread 2: 10
Thread 2: 30
Final value: 10

```
# When to use it?
`One common use case for TLS` is in web applications where each incoming request is typically processed by a new thread from a thread pool. If you have data that needs to be accessed and modified during the processing of the request, but that data should not be shared across threads, then you can use TLS to store that data in a way that is local to the thread.

You might use TLS in situations where you have a resource that is expensive to allocate, or where the resource is not thread-safe and cannot be safely shared between threads. For example, suppose you have a database connection object that is not thread-safe. You could create a separate `ThreadLocal<SqlConnection>` object for each thread that needs to access the database, ensuring that each thread gets its own independent copy of the connection object.

Another use case for thread-local storage is when you have a `static object` that needs to be thread-safe. In this case, you can use thread-local storage to store a separate instance of the object for each thread, ensuring that each thread can access its own instance of the object without worrying about other threads modifying it.

Another use case for TLS is in `GUI applications `where different threads are responsible for different parts of the UI. If you have data that needs to be accessed and modified by a particular thread, but should not be shared with other threads, then you can use TLS to store that data.

TLS can be implemented using the ThreadLocal<T> class in .NET, which allows you to create thread-local variables that are stored separately for each thread. When a new thread is created, it gets its own copy of the thread-local variable, and modifications made to the variable by one thread do not affect the values seen by other threads

# Use cases
`Caching`: If your application needs to cache data, but the data is expensive to compute, you can use TLS to store the cached data on a per-thread basis. This can improve performance by reducing the number of times the data needs to be recomputed.

`Database connections`: In a multi-threaded application, you might need to connect to a database from different threads. If you use TLS to store the database connection object, each thread can have its own connection object without the need for synchronization.

`Logging`: If you need to log data in a multi-threaded application, you can use TLS to store a logging context object on a per-thread basis. This can simplify the logging code, since you don't need to pass the logging context object around between functions.

`Configuration`: If your application needs to read configuration data from a file or a database, you can use TLS to store the configuration data on a per-thread basis. This can reduce the need for synchronization and simplify the code.

`Thread-local data structures`: In some cases, you might need to maintain a data structure that is used only by a single thread. You can use TLS to store the data structure on a per-thread basis, which can simplify the code and improve performance by avoiding synchronization.

`multi-language applications`  in a web application, you can use TLS to store the user's selected language preference, and then use that preference to load the appropriate language-specific resources for the user's session.


`Caching`: When performing operations that are expensive to compute, it can be useful to cache the results to improve performance. However, if the cache is shared across threads, it can introduce synchronization issues. By using thread-local storage, each thread can have its own cache, eliminating the need for synchronization.

`Contextual information`: In some applications, it may be necessary to store contextual information on a per-thread basis. For example, in a web application, each thread may need access to information about the current user session. By using thread-local storage, this information can be stored on a per-thread basis, allowing each thread to access its own session information.

`Performance counters`: In performance-sensitive applications, it can be useful to track performance metrics on a per-thread basis. By using thread-local storage, each thread can update its own performance counters without the need for synchronization with other threads.

```c#
public static class UserSettings
{
    private static ThreadLocal<string> _language = new ThreadLocal<string>();

    public static string Language
    {
        get { return _language.Value; }
        set { _language.Value = value; }
    }
}
UserSettings.Language = "en-US";
```
# [ThreadStatic]
The easiest approach to thread-local storage is to mark a static field with the `ThreadStatic` attribute:
```c#
[ThreadStatic] static int _x;
```
Each thread then sees a separate copy of _x.

Unfortunately, [ThreadStatic] `doesn’t work with instance fields (it simply does nothing); nor does it play well with field initializers—they execute only once on the thread that’s running when the static constructor executes`. If you need to work with instance fields—or start with a nondefault value—ThreadLocal<T> provides a better option. That means, this attribute only works with static fields, not instance fields, which means that you can't use it to create unique instance fields for each thread
```c#
class Foo
{
    // This instance field will be shared across all instances of Foo on the same thread
    [ThreadStatic]
    private static int _threadStaticValue;

    // This instance field will have a unique value per instance of Foo
    private static readonly ThreadLocal<int> _threadLocalValue = new ThreadLocal<int>(() => 0);

    public int GetThreadStaticValue()
    {
        return _threadStaticValue;
    }

    public int GetThreadLocalValue()
    {
        return _threadLocalValue.Value;
    }
}

```
Let's see how these fields behave in practice:
```c#
var foo1 = new Foo();
var foo2 = new Foo();

// Set the thread static value to 1
Foo._threadStaticValue = 1;

// Set the thread local value for foo1 to 2
foo1.GetThreadLocalValue() = 2;

Console.WriteLine(foo1.GetThreadStaticValue()); // Output: 1
Console.WriteLine(foo2.GetThreadStaticValue()); // Output: 1

Console.WriteLine(foo1.GetThreadLocalValue()); // Output: 2
Console.WriteLine(foo2.GetThreadLocalValue()); // Output: 0

```
# ThreadLocal<T>
ThreadLocal<T> provides thread-local storage for `both static and instance fields`, and allows you to specify default values.
Here’s how to create a ThreadLocal<int> with a default value of 3 for each thread:
```c#
 static ThreadLocal<int> _x = new ThreadLocal<int> (() => 3);
```
You then use _x’s Value property to get or set its thread-local value. A bonus of using ThreadLocal is that values are `lazily evaluated: the factory function evaluates on the first call (for each thread).`

Additionally, when using [ThreadStatic], field initializers only execute once on the thread that's running when the static constructor executes. This means that if you need to initialize a thread-local static field with a non-default value or perform initialization on instance fields, [ThreadStatic] won't work, and you'll need to use ThreadLocal<T> instead. `ThreadLocal<T>` allows you to specify an initializer function that will be executed for each thread the first time it accesses the Value property, which allows you to initialize instance fields or set non-default values.

# ThreadLocal<T> and instance fields
ThreadLocal<T> is also useful with instance fields and captured local variables. For example, consider the problem of generating random numbers in a multithreaded environment.

`Since the Random class is not thread-safe`, we cannot use a single instance across multiple threads without synchronizing access to it. This could limit concurrency and affect performance.
```c#
var localRandom = new ThreadLocal<Random>(() => new Random()); Console.WriteLine (localRandom.Value.Next());
```
To avoid this problem, we can use ThreadLocal<T> to create a separate instance of Random for each thread. In the example, the ThreadLocal<T> instance is created with a lambda expression that returns a new instance of Random when accessed through the Value property.

However, the default Random constructor uses the system clock for a random number seed. `If two Random objects are created within the same ~10 ms time interval, they may have the same seed`, resulting in the same sequence of random numbers. To avoid this, the Guid.NewGuid().GetHashCode() method is used to generate a unique seed for each Random object created through the ThreadLocal<T> instance.

Here’s one way to fix it:
```c#
    var localRandom = new ThreadLocal<Random>
     ( () => new Random (Guid.NewGuid().GetHashCode()) );
```


We use this in Chapter 22 (see the parallel spellchecking example in “PLINQ” on page 911).
# GetData and SetData

he third approach is to use two methods in the Thread class: `GetData and SetData`. These store data in thread-specific “slots.” 
  - `Thread.GetData` reads from a thread’s isolated data store;
  - `Thread.SetData` writes to it. Both methods require a Local DataStoreSlot object to identify the slot. You can use the same slot across all threads and they’ll still get separate values. Here’s an example:
```c#
class Test {
// The same LocalDataStoreSlot object can be used across all threads. 
LocalDataStoreSlot _secSlot = Thread.GetNamedDataSlot ("securityLevel");
  // This property has a separate value on each thread.
  int SecurityLevel
  {
get {
object data = Thread.GetData (_secSlot); return data == null ? 0 : (int) data;
  set { Thread.SetData (_secSlot, value); }
}
...
// null == uninitialized
```

## When to use it?
You would typically use these methods when you need to share data across multiple methods or classes that are executed within the same thread, but you don't want to use global or static variables because that could cause synchronization issues or result in unintended data sharing between threads.

For example, you might use `Thread.SetData` to store authentication information for the current user, such as a user ID or access token, so that it can be accessed by various methods or classes within the same thread. Then, you can use `Thread.GetData` to retrieve this information later on.

However, note that `Thread.GetData` and `Thread.SetData` are `considered less safe and less flexible than ThreadLocal<T>, which is a more modern and recommended way to manage thread-local storage in .NET. ThreadLocal<T> provides a typed and safer approach to thread-local storage, which allows you to avoid synchronization issues and handle thread-local data more efficiently.`

# AsyncLocal<T>
The approaches to `thread-local storage that we’ve discussed so far are incompatible with asynchronous functions`, because after an await, execution can resume on a different thread. `The AsyncLocal<T> class solves this by preserving its value across an await`:
```c#
static AsyncLocal<string> _asyncLocalTest = new AsyncLocal<string>();
async void Main()
{
  _asyncLocalTest.Value = "test";
  await Task.Delay (1000);
  // The following works even if we come back on another thread:
  Console.WriteLine (_asyncLocalTest.Value); // test
}
```
`AsyncLocal<T>` is still able to keep operations started on separate threads apart, whether initiated by Thread.Start or Task.Run. The following writes “one one” and “two two”:
```c#
static AsyncLocal<string> _asyncLocalTest = new AsyncLocal<string>();
void Main() {
      // Call Test twice on two concurrent threads:
      new Thread (() => Test ("one")).Start();
      new Thread (() => Test ("two")).Start();
}
    async void Test (string value)
    {
      _asyncLocalTest.Value = value;
      await Task.Delay (1000);
      Console.WriteLine (value + " " + _asyncLocalTest.Value);
}
```
`AsyncLocal<T> `has an interesting and unique nuance: if an AsyncLocal<T> object
already has a value when a thread is started, the new thread will “inherit” that value:
```c#
static AsyncLocal<string> _asyncLocalTest = new AsyncLocal<string>();
void Main() {
  _asyncLocalTest.Value = "test";
  new Thread (AnotherMethod).Start();
}
void AnotherMethod() => Console.WriteLine (_asyncLocalTest.Value); // test 
```
The new thread, however, gets a copy of the value, so any changes that it makes will
not affect the original:
```c#
static AsyncLocal<string> _asyncLocalTest = new AsyncLocal<string>();
void Main() {
  _asyncLocalTest.Value = "test";
  var t = new Thread (AnotherMethod); t.Start(); t.Join();
  Console.WriteLine (_asyncLocalTest.Value);
  // test (not ha-ha!) void AnotherMethod() => _asyncLocalTest.Value = "ha-ha!";
}
```
`Keep in mind `that the new thread gets a shallow copy of the value.
  - So, if you were to replace Async<string> with Async<StringBuilder> or Async<List<string>>, the new thread could clear the StringBuilder or add/remove items to the List<string>, and this would affect the original.
