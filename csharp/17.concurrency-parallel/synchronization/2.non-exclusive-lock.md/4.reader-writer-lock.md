# Reader/Writer Locks
Quite often, instances of a type are thread-safe for concurrent read operations, but not for concurrent updates (nor for a concurrent read and update). This can also be true with resources such as a file. Although protecting instances of such types with a simple exclusive lock for all modes of access usually does the trick, it can unreasonably restrict concurrency if there are many readers and just occasional updates. An example of where this could occur is in a business application server, for which commonly used data is cached for fast retrieval in static fields. The `ReaderWriterLockSlim` class is designed to provide maximum-availability locking in just this scenario.

`ReaderWriterLockSlim` is a replacement for the older “fat” ReaderWriterLock class. The latter is similar in functionality, but it is several times slower and has an inherent design fault in its mechanism for handling lock upgrades.
When compared to an ordinary `lock (Monitor.Enter/Exit)`, `ReaderWriterLockSlim` is still `twice as slow`, though. The trade-off is less contention (when there’s a lot of reading and minimal writing).

With both classes, there are two basic kinds of lock—a read lock and a write lock:
• `A write lock is universally exclusive`.
• `A read lock is compatible with other read locks.`

So, `a thread holding a write lock blocks all other threads trying to obtain a read or write lock (and vice versa). But if no thread holds a write lock, any number of threads may concurrently obtain a read lock.`
ReaderWriterLockSlim defines the following methods for obtaining and releasing read/write locks:
```c#
    public void EnterReadLock();
    public void ExitReadLock();
    public void EnterWriteLock();
    public void ExitWriteLock();

```
Additionally, there are “Try” versions of all EnterXXX methods that accept timeout arguments in the style of Monitor.TryEnter (timeouts can occur quite easily if the resource is heavily contended). ReaderWriterLock provides similar methods, named AcquireXXX and ReleaseXXX. These throw an ApplicationException if a timeout occurs, rather than returning false.

# What is contention?

In the context of concurrency, contention refers to the situation when multiple threads try to access a shared resource or critical section simultaneously, leading to potential race conditions, deadlocks, or livelocks.

`ReaderWriterLockSlim` is a synchronization primitive that allows multiple threads to read a shared resource simultaneously, while providing exclusive access to write operations. This means that multiple threads can access the shared resource concurrently as long as they only perform read operations, but write operations will have exclusive access to the resource.

The benefit of using `ReaderWriterLockSlim` over an ordinary lock is that it reduces contention by allowing multiple threads to read the shared resource concurrently, which can lead to improved performance in scenarios where read operations are more frequent than write operations. However, this comes at the cost of a slightly slower performance compared to an ordinary lock, as `ReaderWriterLockSlim` has more overhead due to the additional logic required to manage the read and write locks.

In summary, `less contention means that there is less competition among threads for accessing a shared resource, which can improve overall concurrency and performance`. `ReaderWriterLockSlim` provides a way to reduce contention by allowing multiple readers to access a shared resource concurrently, while still ensuring exclusive access for write operations.


The following program demonstrates ReaderWriterLockSlim. Three threads con‐ tinually enumerate a list, while two further threads append a random number to the list every 100 ms. A read lock protects the list readers, and a write lock protects the list writers:
```c#
class SlimDemo {
      static ReaderWriterLockSlim _rw = new ReaderWriterLockSlim();
static List<int> _items = new List<int>(); static Random _rand = new Random();
static void Main() {
new Thread (Read).Start(); new Thread (Read).Start(); new Thread (Read).Start();
   new Thread (Write).Start ("A");
        new Thread (Write).Start ("B");
      }
      static void Read()
      {
        while (true)
        {
            Console.WriteLine (_rw.CurrentReadCount + " concurrent readers");
          _rw.EnterReadLock();
          foreach (int i in _items) Thread.Sleep (10);
          _rw.ExitReadLock();
} }
      static void Write (object threadID)
      {
        while (true)
        {
          int newNumber = GetRandNum (100);
          _rw.EnterWriteLock();
          _items.Add (newNumber);
          _rw.ExitWriteLock();
          Console.WriteLine ("Thread " + threadID + " added " + newNumber);
          Thread.Sleep (100);
        }
}
      static int GetRandNum (int max) { lock (_rand) return _rand.Next(max); }
    }
```

`ReaderWriterLockSlim` allows more concurrent Read activity than a simple lock. We can illustrate this by inserting the following line in the Write method, at the start of the while loop:
```c#
    Console.WriteLine (_rw.CurrentReadCount + " concurrent readers");
```
This nearly always prints `“3 concurrent readers”` (the Read methods spend most of their time inside the foreach loops). As well as CurrentReadCount, ReaderWriter LockSlim provides the following properties for monitoring locks:
```c#
public bool IsReadLockHeld
    public bool IsUpgradeableReadLockHeld
    public bool IsWriteLockHeld
    public int  WaitingReadCount
    public int  WaitingUpgradeCount
    public int  WaitingWriteCount
    public int  RecursiveReadCount
    public int  RecursiveUpgradeCount
    public int  RecursiveWriteCount

```

# Upgradeable locks
{ get; } { get; } { get; }
{ get; } { get; } { get; }
{ get; } { get; } { get; }
Sometimes, it’s useful to swap a read lock for a write lock in a single atomic operation. For instance, suppose that you want to add an item to a list only if the item wasn’t already present. Ideally, you’d want to minimize the time spent holding the (exclusive) write lock, so you might proceed as follows:
1. Obtain a read lock.
2. Test whether the item is already present in the list; if so, release the lock and
return.
3. Release the read lock. 4. Obtain a write lock. 5. Add the item.
The problem is that another thread could sneak in and modify the list (e.g., adding the same item) between Steps 3 and 4. ReaderWriterLockSlim addresses this through a third kind of lock called an upgradeable lock. An upgradeable lock is like a read lock except that it can later be promoted to a write lock in an atomic operation. Here’s how you use it:
1. CallEnterUpgradeableReadLock.
2. Perform read-based activities (e.g., test whether the item is already present in
the list).
3. Call EnterWriteLock (this converts the upgradeable lock to a write lock).
4. Perform write-based activities (e.g., add the item to the list).
5. Call ExitWriteLock (this converts the write lock back to an upgradeable lock). 6. Perform any other read-based activities.
7. CallExitUpgradeableReadLock.
From the caller’s perspective, it’s rather like nested or recursive locking. Function‐ ally, though, in Step 3, ReaderWriterLockSlim releases your read lock and obtains a fresh write lock, atomically.

- There’s `another important difference between upgradeable locks and read locks`. Although an upgradeable lock can coexist with any number of read locks, only one upgradeable lock can itself be taken out at a time. This prevents conversion deadlocks by serializing competing conversions—just as update locks do in SQL Server:
  - In a scenario where multiple threads are trying to access the same resource protected by a reader-writer lock, it is possible for two or more threads to hold a read lock, preventing any one of them from upgrading their lock to a write lock. This is known as a "conversion deadlock".
  - To prevent this, an upgradeable lock can coexist with any number of read locks. This means that multiple threads can hold a read lock and one thread can hold an upgradeable lock at the same time. However, only one thread can hold an upgradeable lock at a time. This means that if one thread holds an upgradeable lock, another thread cannot acquire another upgradeable lock until the first upgradeable lock is released.
  - By serializing the acquisition of upgradeable locks, the potential for conversion deadlocks is reduced because threads are prevented from competing with each other to acquire an upgradeable lock.

# Comparison SQL Server and ReaderWriterLockSlim?
- SQL Share lock  = Read lock
- SQL Exclusive lock = Write lock 
- SQL Update lock = Upgradeable lock

## Shared Lock (SQL Server) = Read Lock (ReaderWriterLockSlim)
A shared lock allows multiple transactions to read a specific row or page in the database but prevents any of them from modifying the data until the lock is released. Here's an example of using a shared lock in SQL Server:
```c#
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SELECT * FROM myTable WITH (TABLOCKX, HOLDLOCK);
-- Do some read-only operations
COMMIT TRANSACTION;

```
n `ReaderWriterLockSlim`, a read lock allows multiple threads to read a shared resource but prevents any of them from writing to it until the lock is released:

```c#
_readerWriterLockSlim.EnterReadLock();
// Do some read-only operations
_readerWriterLockSlim.ExitReadLock();
```

## Exclusive Lock (SQL Server) = Write Lock (ReaderWriterLockSlim)
An exclusive lock allows a transaction to modify a specific row or page in the database while preventing other transactions from reading or modifying the data until the lock is released. Here's an example of using an exclusive lock in SQL Server:
```c#
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
UPDATE myTable SET col1 = 'new value' WHERE id = 1;
-- Do some more operations
COMMIT TRANSACTION;

```

In `ReaderWriterLockSlim`, a write lock allows a single thread to modify a shared resource while preventing other threads from reading or writing to it until the lock is released:
```c#
_readerWriterLockSlim.EnterWriteLock();
// Do some write operations
_readerWriterLockSlim.ExitWriteLock();

```

## Update Lock (SQL Server) = Upgradeable Lock (ReaderWriterLockSlim)
An update lock allows a transaction to read a specific row or page in the database with the intention of modifying it later, while preventing other transactions from modifying the data. Here's an example of using an update lock in SQL Server:
```c#
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
SELECT * FROM myTable WITH (UPDLOCK, HOLDLOCK) WHERE id = 1;
-- Do some more operations
COMMIT TRANSACTION;

```

In `ReaderWriterLockSlim`, an upgradeable lock allows a thread to read a shared resource with the intention of upgrading the lock to a write lock later. While the lock is upgradeable, other threads can still read the shared resource but not write to it:

```c#
_readerWriterLockSlim.EnterUpgradeableReadLock();
// Do some read-only operations
if (needToWrite) {
    _readerWriterLockSlim.EnterWriteLock(); // Upgrade the lock to a write lock
    // Do some write operations
    _readerWriterLockSlim.ExitWriteLock();
}
_readerWriterLockSlim.ExitUpgradeableReadLock();

```


Here's an example scenario: Let's say we have a table called Employees with the following columns: EmployeeID, FirstName, LastName, and Salary. We want to increase the salary of a particular employee by 10%, but we also want to prevent other transactions from modifying the same employee's salary while the update is in progress.

To do this, we can use an update lock. Here's some sample T-SQL code that demonstrates how to use an update lock:
```sql
BEGIN TRANSACTION

-- Acquire an update lock on the employee record
SELECT * FROM Employees WITH (UPDLOCK)
WHERE EmployeeID = 12345

-- Perform the salary update
UPDATE Employees
SET Salary = Salary * 1.1
WHERE EmployeeID = 12345

COMMIT TRANSACTION
```
In this example, the WITH (UPDLOCK) hint tells SQL Server to acquire an update lock on the Employees table when performing the SELECT statement. This update lock prevents other transactions from acquiring exclusive locks on the same employee record, which would prevent the salary update from succeeding.

Once the update lock is acquired, we can safely update the employee's salary knowing that no other transaction is modifying the same record. Finally, we commit the transaction to release the update lock and allow other transactions to access the updated data.

We can demonstrate an upgradeable lock by changing the Write method in the preceding example such that it adds a number to the list only if it’s not already present:
```c#

ReaderWriterLockSlim _rw = new ReaderWriterLockSlim();

List<int> _items = new List<int>();

Random _rand = new Random();

new Thread(Read).Start();
new Thread(Read).Start();
new Thread(Read).Start();
new Thread(Write).Start("A");
new Thread(Write).Start("B");

void Read()
{
    int count = 0;
    while (count < 2000)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(_rw.CurrentReadCount + " concurrent readers");
        _rw.EnterReadLock();

        foreach (int i in _items)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Read {i}");
            Thread.Sleep(10);
        }

        _rw.ExitReadLock();
        count++;
    }
}

void Write(object threadID)
{
    int newNumber = GetRandNum(100);
    _rw.EnterUpgradeableReadLock();
    if (!_items.Contains(newNumber))
    {
        _rw.EnterWriteLock();
        _items.Add(newNumber);
        _rw.ExitWriteLock();
        Console.WriteLine("Thread " + threadID + " added " + newNumber);
    }

    _rw.ExitUpgradeableReadLock();
    Thread.Sleep(100);
}

int GetRandNum(int max)
{
    lock (_rand) return _rand.Next(max);
}

```

`ReaderWriterLock` can also do lock conversions —but unreli‐ ably because it doesn’t support the concept of upgradeable locks. This is why the designers of ReaderWriterLockSlim had to start afresh with a new class.

# what is lock conversions ?
In the context of concurrency and locking mechanisms, a lock conversion refers to changing the type of lock held on a resource. For example, a thread may initially acquire a read lock on a shared resource, and then later upgrade it to a write lock in order to modify the resource.

Lock conversions can be tricky to manage, as they can potentially cause deadlocks and other issues if not properly synchronized. This is especially true when multiple threads are attempting to acquire and release locks on the same set of resources.

# Lock recursion
Ordinarily, nested or recursive locking is prohibited with ReaderWriterLockSlim. Hence, the following throws an exception:
```c#
    var rw = new ReaderWriterLockSlim();
    rw.EnterReadLock();
    rw.EnterReadLock();
    rw.ExitReadLock();
    rw.ExitReadLock();
```
It runs without error, however, if you construct ReaderWriterLockSlim as follows:
```c#
 var rw = new ReaderWriterLockSlim (LockRecursionPolicy.SupportsRecursion);
```
This ensures that recursive locking can happen only if you plan for it. Recursive locking can create undesired complexity because it’s possible to acquire more than one kind of lock:
```c#
rw.EnterWriteLock(); rw.EnterReadLock();
Console.WriteLine (rw.IsReadLockHeld); Console.WriteLine (rw.IsWriteLockHeld); rw.ExitReadLock();
rw.ExitWriteLock();
// True
// True
```
The basic rule is that after you’ve acquired a lock, subsequent recursive locks can be less, but not greater, on the following scale:
```c#
Read Lock→Upgradeable Lock→Write Lock
```
A request to promote an upgradeable lock to a write lock, however, is always legal.

This `rule` means that if a thread has already acquired a read lock on a resource, it can acquire another read lock on the same resource without any issue. However, if it wants to acquire an `upgradeable` lock, it must first release the `read` lock. Similarly, if a thread has already acquired an `upgradeable` lock, it can acquire another `upgradeable` lock on the same resource or release the `upgradeable` lock to acquire a `write` lock. But if it wants to acquire a `read` lock, it must first release the `upgradeable` lock.

This rule is in place to prevent lock conversions that can cause deadlocks or other synchronization issues. By limiting the types of locks that can be acquired after an initial lock has been obtained, the likelihood of conflicting lock requests is reduced, and the potential for deadlock is minimized.

```c#
class Example
{
    private ReaderWriterLockSlim _lock = new ReaderWriterLockSlim();

    public void MethodA()
    {
        _lock.EnterReadLock();
        MethodB();
        _lock.ExitReadLock();
    }

    public void MethodB()
    {
        _lock.EnterUpgradeableReadLock();
        if (someCondition)
        {
            _lock.EnterWriteLock(); // This is allowed because it's a recursive lock of a higher level
            // Do something that requires a write lock
            _lock.ExitWriteLock();
        }
        // Do something that requires an upgradeable lock
        _lock.ExitUpgradeableReadLock();
    }
}

```
In this example, MethodA acquires a read lock on the lock object, and then calls MethodB. MethodB first acquires an upgradeable read lock, and then checks a condition. If the condition is true, it upgrades the lock to a write lock using _lock.EnterWriteLock(), which is allowed because a write lock is a higher level lock than an upgradeable read lock. It can then perform some operation that requires a write lock. If the condition is false, it performs some operation that requires only an upgradeable read lock, and then releases the upgradeable read lock using _lock.ExitUpgradeableReadLock()
