# Lazy Initialization

A frequent problem in threading is how to lazily initialize a shared field in a thread-safe fashion. The need arises when you have a field of a type that’s expensive to construct:
```c#
class Foo {
  public readonly Expensive Expensive = new Expensive();
  ...
}

class Expensive {  /* Suppose this is expensive to construct */  }
```
The problem with this code is that instantiating Foo incurs the performance cost of instantiating Expensive—regardless of whether the Expensive field is ever accessed. The obvious answer is to construct the instance on demand:
```c#
class Foo {
  Expensive _expensive;
  public Expensive Expensive
  {
    get {
      // Lazily instantiate Expensive
      if (_expensive == null) _expensive = new Expensive();
            return _expensive;
    }
  }
... }
```
## The question then arises, is this thread-safe?
Aside from the fact that we’re accessing `_expensive` outside a lock without a memory barrier, consider what would happen if two threads accessed this property at once. They could both satisfy the if statement’s predicate and each thread end up with a different instance of Expensive. It means that the `Expensive object is not being properly synchronized and there is a potential race condition`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and data inconsistencies if both threads are attempting to modify or access the same data within the Expensive object.
Because this can lead to subtle errors, we would say, in general, that this code `is not thread-safe.` 

The solution to the problem is to lock around checking and initializing the object:
```c#
Expensive _expensive;
readonly object _expenseLock = new object();
public Expensive Expensive
{
  get {
      lock (_expenseLock)
      {
        if (_expensive == null) _expensive = new Expensive();
          return _expensive;
      }
  }
}
```
# Lazy<T>
The` Lazy<T> `class is available to help with `lazy initialization`. If instantiated with an argument of true, it implements the thread-safe initialization pattern just described.

`Note`: `Lazy<T> `actually implements a micro-optimized version of this pattern, called `double-checked locking`. Double-checked locking performs an additional `volatile` read to avoid the cost of obtaining a lock if the object is already initialized.

To use `Lazy<T>`, instantiate the class with a value factory delegate that tells it how to initialize a new value, and the argument true. Then, access its value via the Value property:
```c#
Lazy<Expensive> _expensive = new Lazy<Expensive> (() => new Expensive(), true);
public Expensive Expensive { get { return _expensive.Value; } }
```

If you pass `false` into `Lazy<T>’s constructor`, `it implements the thread-unsafe lazy initialization pattern that we described at the beginning of this section—this makes sense when you want to use Lazy<T> in a single-threaded context.`

# LazyInitializer
`LazyInitializer` is a static class that works exactly like `Lazy<T> except`:
  - Its functionality is exposed through a static method that operates directly on a field in your own type. This prevents a level of indirection, improving performance in cases where you need extreme optimization.
  - `It offers another mode of initialization in which multiple threads can race to initialize`.
Overall, the EnsureInitialized<T> method provides a way to allow multiple threads to race to initialize an object, while still ensuring that the initialization is thread-safe and that only one thread initializes the object.

To use `LazyInitializer`, call `EnsureInitialized` before accessing the field, pass‐ ing a reference to the field and the factory delegate:

```c#
Expensive _expensive;
public Expensive Expensive
{
      get   // Implement double-checked locking
      {
        LazyInitializer.EnsureInitialized (ref _expensive,
                                          () => new Expensive());
        return _expensive;
      }
}
```

You can also pass in another argument to request that competing threads race to initialize. This sounds similar to our original thread-unsafe example except that the first thread to finish always wins—and so you end up with only one instance. `The advantage of this technique is that it’s even faster (on multicores) than double-checked locking because it can be implemented entirely without locks using advanced techniques that we describe in “Nonblocking Synchronization” and “Lazy Initialization”` at http://albahari.com/threading. This is an extreme (and rarely needed) optimization that comes at a cost:
  • `It’s slower when more threads race to initialize than you have cores.`
  • It potentially wastes CPU resources performing redundant initialization.
  • The initialization logic must be thread-safe (in this case, it would be thread- unsafe if Expensive’s constructor wrote to static fields, for instance).
  • If the initializer instantiates an object requiring disposal, the “wasted” object won’t be disposed without additional logic.

For reference, here’s how double-checked locking is implemented:
```c#
volatile Expensive _expensive;
public Expensive Expensive
{
  get
  {
    if (_expensive == null)             // First check (outside lock)
      lock (_expenseLock)
        if (_expensive == null)         // Second check (inside lock)
          _expensive = new Expensive();
    return _expensive;
  }
}
```
And here’s how the race-to-initialize pattern is implemented:
```c#
volatile Expensive _expensive;
public Expensive Expensive
{
  get
  {
    if (_expensive == null)
    {
      var instance = new Expensive();
      Interlocked.CompareExchange (ref _expensive, instance, null);
    }
    return _expensive;
  }
}
```
# what different LazyInitializer and Lazy?
`LazyInitializer` is a static class that provides methods to safely initialize a field or property with a default value only once, and to return the value. It is typically used to initialize a field or property in a multithreaded environment where the object must be created only once. The initialization of the object is done atomically and in a thread-safe manner, without the need for any synchronization constructs like locks. The LazyInitializer class provides a few different methods for initializing an object, depending on the scenario.

`Lazy`, on the other hand, is a generic class that provides a way to defer the creation of an object until it is actually needed. The Lazy class provides thread-safe lazy initialization of the object and supports different modes of initialization, such as whether the initialization should be done on the calling thread or on a separate thread. It also allows you to specify the thread safety and execution mode of the initialization.

In summary, `LazyInitializer` is used to safely initialize an object in a thread-safe manner, while `Lazy` is used to defer the creation of an object until it is actually needed, with thread-safe initialization.

# LazyInitializer offers another mode of initialization in which multiple threads can race to initialize while Lazy did not have. What does it mean?
When you create a Lazy<T> instance, the actual initialization of the T value is deferred until it is actually requested for the first time. At that point, a single thread will be responsible for initializing the value, while all other threads that access it will be blocked until the initialization is complete.

For example, let's say you have the following code:

```c#
Lazy<Expensive> lazy = new Lazy<Expensive>();
//...
Expensive expensive = lazy.Value;
```
When the lazy.Value property is accessed for the first time, a single thread will execute the initialization code to create the Expensive object. If multiple threads attempt to access the lazy.Value property before it is initialized, they will all block until the initialization is complete.

This behavior is useful when you want to ensure that the initialization of an object is performed only once, and you want to avoid the overhead of locking or other synchronization mechanisms.

`LazyInitializer` offers an `"Enforced Multiple Initialization"` mode, which means that multiple threads can race to initialize an object. In this mode, if multiple threads attempt to initialize the object simultaneously, they will all execute the initialization logic, but only one of them will actually complete the initialization and set the value. The other threads will simply return the already-initialized value.

This can be useful in cases where you have a large number of threads that may need to access the same object, and you want to avoid blocking them while the object is being initialized. However, it is important to note that using this mode of initialization can result in a race condition, so you should use it only when you are sure that it will not cause any issues in your specific use case.

# what the performance between Lazy and LazyInitializer?
In general, `LazyInitializer` can offer better performance in scenarios where extreme optimization is required, such as when dealing with a large number of threads that may need to access the same object. This is because `LazyInitializer` operates directly on a field in your own type and does not introduce an extra level of indirection like Lazy does. Additionally, `LazyInitializer` provides an option for multiple threads to race to initialize an object, which can `help avoid blocking them while the object is being initialized.`

However, in other scenarios where extreme optimization is not necessary or where initialization is not a bottleneck, `Lazy` can be a simpler and more straightforward option to use. It also has a broader feature set, such as` supporting thread-safe lazy initialization of read-only objects and providing options for controlling thread-safety and exception handling during initialization.`
