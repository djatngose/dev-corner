# Timers
If you need to execute some method repeatedly at r`egular intervals, the easiest way is with a timer`. Timers are convenient and efficient in their use of memory and resources—compared with techniques such as the following:
```c#
new Thread (delegate() { {
  while (enabled)
  DoSomeAction();
  Thread.Sleep (TimeSpan.FromHours (24));
}
}).Start();
```
Not only does this permanently tie up a thread resource, but without additional coding, DoSomeAction will happen at a later time each day. `Timers` solve these problems.

NET provides five timers. Two of these are general-purpose multithreaded timers: • System.Threading.Timer
• System.Timers.Timer
The other two are special-purpose single-threaded timers:
• System.Windows.Forms.Timer (Windows Forms timer)
• System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherTimer (WPF timer)

The `multithreaded timers are more powerful, accurate, and flexible; the single- threaded timers are safer and more convenient for running simple tasks that update Windows Forms controls or WPF elements`.
Finally, from `.NET 6`, there’s the `PeriodicTimer`, which we will cover first.

## PeriodicTimer
`PeriodicTimer is not really a timer`; it’s a class to help with `asynchronous looping`. It’s important to consider that since the advent of async and await, traditional timers are not usually necessary. Instead, the following pattern works nicely:
```c#
async void StartPeriodicOperation()
{
  while (true) {
  await Task.Delay (1000);
  Console.WriteLine ("Tick");
// Do some action
  }
}
```
`Note`: if you call `StartPeriodicOperation` from a UI thread, it will behave as a single-threaded timer, because the await will always return on the same synchronization context.
You can make it behave as a `multithreaded timer simply by adding .ConfigureAwait(false) to the await`.

`PeriodicTimer` is a class to simplify this pattern:
```c#
    var timer = new PeriodicTimer (TimeSpan.FromSeconds (1));
    StartPeriodicOperation();
    // Optionally dispose timer when you want to stop looping.
    async void StartPeriodicOperation()
    {
      while (await timer.WaitForNextTickAsync())
        Console.WriteLine ("Tick");    // Do some action
}
```
`PeriodicTimer` also allows you to `stop the timer by disposing the timer instance`. This results in `WaitForNextTickAsync` returning `false`, allowing the loop to end.

## Multithreaded Timers

System.Threading.Timer is the simplest multithreaded timer: it has just a con‐ structor and two methods (a delight for minimalists, as well as book authors!). In the following example, a timer calls the Tick method, which writes “tick...” after five seconds have elapsed, and then every second after that, until the user presses Enter:

```c#
using System;
using System.Threading;
    // First interval = 5000ms; subsequent intervals = 1000ms
    Timer tmr = new Timer (Tick, "tick...", 5000, 1000);
Console.ReadLine();
tmr.Dispose(); // This both stops the timer and cleans up.
    void Tick (object data)
    {
      // This runs on a pooled thread
      Console.WriteLine (data);          // Writes "tick..."
    }

```
You can change a timer’s interval later by calling its Change method. If you want a timer to fire just once, specify Timeout.Infinite in the constructor’s last argument.
.NET provides another timer class of the same name in the System.Timers name‐ space. This simply wraps the System.Threading.Timer, providing additional con‐ venience while using the identical underlying engine. Here’s a summary of its added features:
• An IComponent implementation, allowing it to be sited in Visual Studio’s Designer’s component tray
• An Interval property instead of a Change method
• An Elapsed event instead of a callback delegate
• An Enabled property to start and stop the timer (its default value being false)
• Start and Stop methods in case you’re confused by Enabled
• An AutoReset flag for indicating a recurring event (default value is true)
• A SynchronizingObject property with Invoke and BeginInvoke methods for safely calling methods on WPF elements and Windows Forms controls

Here’s an example:
```c#
using System;
using System.Timers;
var tmr = new Timer();
tmr.Interval = 500;
tmr.Elapsed += tmr_Elapsed;
tmr.Start();
Console.ReadLine();
tmr.Stop();
Console.ReadLine();
tmr.Start();
Console.ReadLine();
tmr.Dispose();
// Timers namespace rather than Threading
// Doesn't require any args
// Uses an event instead of a delegate
// Start the timer
// Stop the timer
// Restart the timer
// Permanently stop the timer
void tmr_Elapsed (object sender, EventArgs e) => Console.WriteLine ("Tick");
```

Multithreaded timers use the thread pool to allow a few threads to serve many timers. This means that the callback method or Elapsed event can fire on a different thread each time it is called. Furthermore, the Elapsed event always fires (approxi‐ mately) on time—regardless of whether the previous Elapsed event finished execut‐ ing. Hence, callbacks or event handlers must be thread-safe.

The precision of multithreaded timers depends on the OS, and is typically in the 10- to 20-millisecond region. If you need greater precision, you can use native interop and call the Windows multimedia timer. This has precision down to one millisecond, and it is defined in winmm.dll. First call timeBeginPeriod to inform the OS that you need high timing precision, and then call timeSetEvent to start a multimedia timer. When you’re done, call timeKillEvent to stop the timer and timeEndPeriod to inform the OS that you no longer need high timing precision. Chapter 24 demonstrates calling external methods with P/Invoke. You can find complete examples on the internet that use the multimedia timer by searching for the keywords dllimport winmm.dll timesetevent.

# Single-Threaded Timers

.NET provides timers designed to eliminate thread-safety issues for WPF and Win‐ dows Forms applications:
• System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherTimer (WPF) • System.Windows.Forms.Timer (Windows Forms)
The single-threaded timers are not designed to work outside their respective environments. If you use a Windows Forms timer in a Windows Service application, for instance, the Timer event won’t fire!
Both are like System.Timers.Timer in the members that they expose—Interval, Start, and Stop (and Tick, which is equivalent to Elapsed)—and are used in a similar manner. However, they differ in how they work internally. Instead of firing timer events on pooled threads, they post the events to the WPF or Windows Forms message loop. This means that the Tick event always fires on the same thread that originally created the timer—which, in a normal application, is the same thread used to manage all user interface elements and controls. This has a number of benefits:
• You can forget about thread safety.
• A fresh Tick will never fire until the previous Tick has finished processing.
• You can update user interface elements and controls directly from Tick event handling code without calling Control.BeginInvoke or Dispatcher.Begin Invoke.

Thus, a program employing these timers is not really multithreaded: you end up with the same kind of pseudo-concurrency that’s described in Chapter 14 with asynchronous functions that execute on a UI thread. One thread serves all timers as well as the processing UI events, which means that the Tick event handler must execute quickly, otherwise the UI becomes unresponsive.
This makes the WPF and Windows Forms timers suitable for small jobs, typically updating some aspect of the UI (e.g., a clock or countdown display).
In terms of precision, the single-threaded timers are similar to the multithreaded timers (tens of milliseconds), although they are typically less accurate because they can be delayed while other UI requests (or other timer events) are processed.

# Single-Threaded Timers vs Multithreaded Timers
Single-threaded timers and multithreaded timers are two different types of timers that can be used in a multithreaded environment.

A `single-threaded` timer is a timer that executes its callback on a single thread, typically the main thread of the application. This means that the timer callback is executed on the same thread that created the timer, and if the timer callback takes a long time to execute, it can block the main thread and make the application unresponsive. Single-threaded timers are often used in applications that have a simple user interface and don't require high performance.

In contrast, a `multithreaded` timer is a timer that executes its callback on a separate thread. This means that the timer callback is executed independently of the main thread, and the main thread can continue processing user input and updating the user interface while the timer callback is running. Multithreaded timers are often used in applications that require high performance and responsiveness.

The choice between single-threaded and multithreaded timers depends on the specific requirements of the application. If the application has a simple user interface and doesn't require high performance, a single-threaded timer may be sufficient. However, if the application requires high performance and responsiveness, a multithreaded timer may be necessary to ensure that the main thread is not blocked by long-running timer callbacks.
