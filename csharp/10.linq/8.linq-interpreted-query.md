# Interpreted Queries
LINQ provides two parallel architectures: `local queries for local object collections and interpreted queries for remote data sources`. So far, we’ve examined the architecture of local queries, which operate over collections implementing IEnumerable<T>.
  - `Local queries resolve to query operators in the Enumerable class (by default), which in turn resolve to chains of decorator sequences`. The delegates that they accept—whether expressed in query syntax, fluent syntax, or traditional delegates—are fully local to Intermediate Language (IL) code, just like any other C# method.
  - By contrast, `interpreted queries` are descriptive. They operate over sequences that implement `IQueryable<T>`, and they resolve to the query operators in the Queryable class, which emit `expression trees that are interpreted at runtime`. These expression trees can be translated, for instance, to `SQL queries`, allowing you to use LINQ to query a database.

`NOTE`
The query operators in `Enumerable` can actually work with `IQueryable<T>` sequences. The difficulty is that the resultant queries always execute locally on the client. This is why a second set of query operators is provided in the Queryable class.

To write interpreted queries, you need to start with an API that exposes sequences of type `IQueryable<T>`. An example is `Microsoft’s Entity Framework Core (EF Core)`, which allows you to query a variety of databases, including `SQL Server, Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.`

It’s also possible to generate an `IQueryable<T> wrapper` around an ordinary enumerable collection by calling the `AsQueryable method`. 

`NOTE`
`IQueryable<T> is an extension of IEnumerable<T>` with additional methods for `constructing expression trees`. Most of the time you can ignore the details of these methods; they’re called indirectly by the runtime. “Building Query Expressions” covers IQueryable<T> in more detail.

To illustrate, let’s create a simple customer table in SQL Server and populate it with a few names using the following SQL script:
```sql
create table Customer
(
  ID int not null primary key,
  Name varchar(30)
)
insert Customer values (1, 'Tom')
insert Customer values (2, 'Dick')
insert Customer values (3, 'Harry')
insert Customer values (4, 'Mary')
insert Customer values (5, 'Jay')
```
With this table in place, we can write an interpreted LINQ query in C# that uses EF Core to retrieve customers whose name contains the letter “a,” as follows:
```c#
using System;
using System.Linq;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;

using var dbContext = new NutshellContext();

IQueryable<string> query = from c in dbContext.Customers
  where   c.Name.Contains ("a")
  orderby c.Name.Length
  select  c.Name.ToUpper();

foreach (string name in query) Console.WriteLine (name);

public class Customer
{
  public int ID { get; set; }
  public string Name { get; set; }
}

// We’ll explain the following class in more detail in the next section.
public class NutshellContext : DbContext
{
  public virtual DbSet<Customer> Customers { get; set; }

  protected override void OnConfiguring (DbContextOptionsBuilder builder)
    => builder.UseSqlServer ("...connection string...");

  protected override void OnModelCreating (ModelBuilder modelBuilder)
    => modelBuilder.Entity<Customer>().ToTable ("Customer")
                                      .HasKey (c => c.ID);
}
```
EF Core translates this query into the following SQL:
```sql
SELECT UPPER([c].[Name])
FROM [Customers] AS [c]
WHERE CHARINDEX(N'a', [c].[Name]) > 0
ORDER BY CAST(LEN([c].[Name]) AS int)
```
Here’s the end result:
```c#
// JAY
// MARY
// HARRY
```
# Which operator make the EF generate sql query and call to database from IQueryable?
n Entity Framework, the `ToList, ToArray, FirstOrDefault, First, SingleOrDefault, Single, and Count` extension methods are examples of operators that trigger the execution of an IQueryable and cause the query to be translated to SQL and executed against the database.

When one of these methods is called on an IQueryable object, the query is sent to the database and executed, and the results are returned to the client as a list, array, or single object.

For example, let's say we have an IQueryable<Person> and we want to retrieve the first person whose age is greater than 25. Here's how we could do it:

csharp
Copy code
var dbContext = new MyDbContext();
var person = dbContext.People
    .Where(p => p.Age > 25)
    .FirstOrDefault();
In this case, the FirstOrDefault method will trigger the execution of the query and cause Entity Framework to generate and execute a SQL query that retrieves the first person whose age is greater than 25.

In summary, the `ToList, ToArray, FirstOrDefault, First, SingleOrDefault, Single, and Count` extension methods are examples of LINQ operators that `trigger the execution of an IQueryable and cause the query to be translated to SQL and executed against the database.`

# How Interpreted Queries Work
Let’s examine how the preceding query is processed.

First, the compiler converts query syntax to fluent syntax. This is done exactly as with local queries:

IQueryable<string> query = dbContext.customers
                                    .Where   (n => n.Name.Contains ("a"))
                                    .OrderBy (n => n.Name.Length)
                                    .Select  (n => n.Name.ToUpper());
Next, the compiler resolves the query operator methods. Here’s where local and interpreted queries differ—interpreted queries resolve to query operators in the Queryable class instead of the Enumerable class.

To see why, we need to look at the dbContext.Customers variable, the source upon which the entire query builds. dbContext.Customers is of type DbSet<T>, which implements IQueryable<T> (a subtype of IEnumerable<T>). This means that the compiler has a choice in resolving Where: it could call the extension method in Enumerable or the following extension method in Queryable:

public static IQueryable<TSource> Where<TSource> (this
  IQueryable<TSource> source, Expression <Func<TSource,bool>> predicate)
The compiler chooses Queryable.Where because its signature is a more specific match.

Queryable.Where accepts a predicate wrapped in an Expression<TDelegate> type. This instructs the compiler to translate the supplied lambda expression—in other words, n=>n.Name.Contains("a")—to an expression tree rather than a compiled delegate. An expression tree is an object model based on the types in System.Linq.Expressions that can be inspected at runtime (so that EF Core can later translate it to an SQL statement).

Because Queryable.Where also returns IQueryable<T>, the same process follows with the OrderBy and Select operators. Figure 8-9 illustrates the end result. In the shaded box, there is an expression tree describing the entire query, which can be traversed at runtime.

# Execution
Interpreted queries follow a deferred execution model—just like local queries. This means that the SQL statement is not generated until you start enumerating the query. Further, enumerating the same query twice results in the database being queried twice.

`Under the hood, interpreted queries differ from local queries in how they execute. When you enumerate over an interpreted query, the outermost sequence runs a program that traverses the entire expression tree, processing it as a unit. In our example, EF Core translates the expression tree to an SQL statement, which it then executes, yielding the results as a sequence.`

`NOTE`
To work, EF Core needs to understand the schema of the database. It does this by leveraging conventions, code attributes, and a fluent configuration API. We’ll explore this in detail later in the chapter.

We said previously that a LINQ query is like a production line. However, when you enumerate an IQueryable conveyor belt, it doesn’t start up the whole production line, like with a local query. Instead, just the IQueryable belt starts up, with a special enumerator that calls upon a production manager. The manager reviews the entire production line—which consists not of compiled code but of dummies (method call expressions) with instructions pasted to their foreheads (expression trees). The manager then traverses all the expressions, in this case transcribing them to a single piece of paper (an SQL statement), which it then executes, feeding the results back to the consumer. Only one belt turns; the rest of the production line is a network of empty shells, existing just to describe what needs to be done. `The key difference here is that the IQueryable query is not executed immediately. Instead, it creates an expression tree that describes the query, which can be translated into a SQL statement and executed against a database when the results are needed. This allows LINQ to optimize queries and execute them more efficiently, without having to generate code for every single query.`

This has some practical implications. For instance, with local queries, you can write your own query methods (fairly easily, with iterators) and then use them to supplement the predefined set. With remote queries, this is difficult and even undesirable. If you wrote a MyWhere extension method accepting IQueryable<T>, it would be like putting your own dummy into the production line. The production manager wouldn’t know what to do with your dummy. Even if you intervened at this stage, your solution would be hardwired to a particular provider, such as EF Core, and would not work with other IQueryable implementations. Part of the benefit of having a standard set of methods in Queryable is that they define a standard vocabulary for querying any remote collection. As soon as you try to extend the vocabulary, you’re no longer interoperable.

Another consequence of this model is that an IQueryable provider might be unable to cope with some queries—even if you stick to the standard methods. EF Core is limited by the capabilities of the database server; some LINQ queries have no SQL translation. If you’re familiar with SQL, you’ll have a good intuition for what these are, although at times you’ll need to experiment to see what causes a runtime error; it can be surprising what does work!

# Combining Interpreted and Local Queries
A query can include both interpreted and local operators. A typical pattern is to have the local operators on the outside and the interpreted components on the inside; in other words, the interpreted queries feed the local queries. This pattern works well when querying a database.

For instance, suppose that we write a custom extension method to pair up strings in a collection:

public static IEnumerable<string> Pair (this IEnumerable<string> source)
{
  string firstHalf = null;
  foreach (string element in source)
    if (firstHalf == null)
      firstHalf = element;
    else
    {
      yield return firstHalf + ", " + element;
      firstHalf = null;
    }
}
We can use this extension method in a query that mixes EF Core and local operators:
```c#
using var dbContext = new NutshellContext ();
IEnumerable<string> q = dbContext.Customers
  .Select (c => c.Name.ToUpper())
  .OrderBy (n => n)
  .Pair()                         // Local from this point on.
  .Select ((n, i) => "Pair " + i.ToString() + " = " + n);

foreach (string element in q) Console.WriteLine (element);

// Pair 0 = DICK, HARRY
// Pair 1 = JAY, 
```
Because dbContext.Customers is of a type implementing IQueryable<T>, the Select operator resolves to Queryable.Select. This returns an output sequence also of type IQueryable<T>, so the OrderBy operator similarly resolves to Queryable.OrderBy. But the next query operator, Pair, has no overload accepting IQueryable<T>—only the less specific IEnumerable<T>. So, it resolves to our local Pair method—wrapping the interpreted query in a local query. Pair also returns IEnumerable, so the Select that follows resolves to another local operator.

On the EF Core side, the resulting SQL statement is equivalent to this:
```c#
SELECT UPPER([c].[Name]) FROM [Customers] AS [c] ORDER BY UPPER([c].[Name])
```
The remaining work is done locally. In effect, we end up with a local query (on the outside) whose source is an interpreted query (the inside).

# AsEnumerable
`Enumerable.AsEnumerable` is the simplest of all query operators. Here’s its complete definition:
```c#
public static IEnumerable<TSource> AsEnumerable<TSource>
              (this IEnumerable<TSource> source)
{
    return source;
}
```
Its purpose is to cast an IQueryable<T> sequence to IEnumerable<T>, forcing subsequent query operators to bind to Enumerable operators instead of Queryable operators. This causes the remainder of the query to execute locally.

To illustrate, suppose that we had a MedicalArticles table in SQL Server and wanted to use EF Core to retrieve all articles on influenza whose abstract contained fewer than 100 words. For the latter predicate, we need a regular expression:
```c#
Regex wordCounter = new Regex (@"\b(\w|[-'])+\b");

using var dbContext = new NutshellContext ();

var query = dbContext.MedicalArticles
  .Where (article => article.Topic == "influenza" &&
                     wordCounter.Matches (article.Abstract).Count < 100);
```
The problem is that SQL Server doesn’t support regular expressions, so EF Core will throw an exception, complaining that the query cannot be translated to SQL. We can solve this by querying in two steps: first retrieving all articles on influenza through an EF Core query, and then filtering locally for abstracts of fewer than 100 words:
```c#
Regex wordCounter = new Regex (@"\b(\w|[-'])+\b");

using var dbContext = new NutshellContext ();

IEnumerable<MedicalArticle> efQuery = dbContext.MedicalArticles
  .Where (article => article.Topic == "influenza");

IEnumerable<MedicalArticle> localQuery = efQuery
  .Where (article => wordCounter.Matches (article.Abstract).Count < 100);

```

Because efQuery is of type IEnumerable<MedicalArticle>, the second query binds to the local query operators, forcing that part of the filtering to run on the client.

With `AsEnumerable`, we can do the same in a single query:
```c#
Regex wordCounter = new Regex (@"\b(\w|[-'])+\b");

using var dbContext = new NutshellContext ();

var query = dbContext.MedicalArticles
  .Where (article => article.Topic == "influenza")

  .AsEnumerable()
  .Where (article => wordCounter.Matches (article.Abstract).Count < 100);
```
An alternative to calling `AsEnumerable` is to call `ToArray or ToList`. The `advantage of AsEnumerable is that it doesn’t force immediate query execution, nor does it create any storage structure.`

Here's an example to illustrate the difference between `AsEnumerable and ToList`:
```c#
using var dbContext = new MyDbContext();

// This query will retrieve all the products from the database.
var productsQuery = dbContext.Products;

// This will execute the query immediately and store the results in a List<Product>.
var productsList = productsQuery.ToList();

// This will filter the List<Product> in memory using LINQ-to-Objects.
var cheapProducts = productsList.Where(p => p.Price < 10);

var firstCheapProduct = cheapProducts.FirstOrDefault();

```
let's see how the same code would behave if we used AsEnumerable instead of ToList:
```c#
using var dbContext = new MyDbContext();

// This query will retrieve all the products from the database.
var productsQuery = dbContext.Products;

// This will convert the IQueryable<Product> to an IEnumerable<Product>, but will not execute the query yet.
var productsEnumerable = productsQuery.AsEnumerable();

// This will filter the IEnumerable<Product> in memory using LINQ-to-Objects.
var cheapProducts = productsEnumerable.Where(p => p.Price < 10);

// This will execute the remaining part of the query against the database and return the first cheap product.
var firstCheapProduct = cheapProducts.FirstOrDefault();

```
