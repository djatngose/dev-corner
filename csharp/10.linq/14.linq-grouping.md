# Grouping
Method	Description	SQL equivalents
`GroupBy`	Groups a sequence into subsequences	GROUP BY
`Chunk`	Groups a sequence into arrays of a fixed size
# Overview
GroupBy organizes a flat input sequence into sequences of groups. For example, the following organizes all of the files in Path.GetTempPath() by extension:
```c#
string[] files = Directory.GetFiles (Path.GetTempPath());

IEnumerable<IGrouping<string,string>> query =
  files.GroupBy (file => Path.GetExtension (file));
Or, with implicit typing:
```
var query = files.GroupBy (file => Path.GetExtension (file));
Here’s how to enumerate the result:
```c#
foreach (IGrouping<string,string> grouping in query)
{
  Console.WriteLine ("Extension: " + grouping.Key);
  foreach (string filename in grouping)
    Console.WriteLine ("   - " + filename);
}
```

Enumerable.GroupBy works by reading the input elements into a temporary dictionary of lists so that all elements with the same key end up in the same sublist. It then emits a sequence of groupings. A grouping is a sequence with a Key property:

public interface IGrouping <TKey,TElement> : IEnumerable<TElement>,
                                             IEnumerable
{
  TKey Key { get; }    // Key applies to the subsequence as a whole
}
By default, the elements in each grouping are untransformed input elements unless you specify an elementSelector argument. The following projects each input element to uppercase:

files.GroupBy (file => Path.GetExtension (file), file => file.ToUpper());
An elementSelector is independent of the keySelector. In our case, this means that the Key on each grouping is still in its original case:

  Note that the subcollections are not emitted in alphabetical order of key. GroupBy merely groups; it does not sort. In fact, it preserves the original ordering. To sort, you must add an OrderBy operator:

files.GroupBy (file => Path.GetExtension (file), file => file.ToUpper())
     .OrderBy (grouping => grouping.Key);
GroupBy has a simple and direct translation in query syntax:

group element-expr by key-expr
Here’s our example in query syntax:

from file in files
group file.ToUpper() by Path.GetExtension (file);
As with select, group “ends” a query—unless you add a query continuation clause:

from file in files
group file.ToUpper() by Path.GetExtension (file) into grouping
orderby grouping.Key
select grouping;

Query continuations are often useful in a group by query. The next query filters out groups that have fewer than five files in them:

from file in files
group file.ToUpper() by Path.GetExtension (file) into grouping
where grouping.Count() >= 5
select grouping;
`NOTE`
A where after a group by is equivalent to HAVING in SQL. It applies to each subsequence or grouping as a whole rather than the individual elements.

Sometimes, you’re interested purely in the result of an aggregation on a grouping and so can abandon the subsequences:
```c#
string[] votes = { "Dogs", "Cats", "Cats", "Dogs", "Dogs" };

IEnumerable<string> query = from vote in votes
                            group vote by vote into g
                            orderby g.Count() descending
                            select g.Key;

string winner = query.First();    // Dogs
```

# GroupBy in EF Core
Grouping works in the same way when querying a database. If you have navigation properties set up, you’ll find, however, that the need to group arises less frequently than with standard SQL. For instance, to select customers with at least two purchases, you don’t need to group; the following query does the job nicely:
```c#
from c in dbContext.Customers
where c.Purchases.Count >= 2
select c.Name + " has made " + c.Purchases.Count + " purchases"
```
An example of when you might use grouping is to list total sales by year:
```c#
from p in dbContext.Purchases
group p.Price by p.Date.Year into salesByYear
select new {
             Year       = salesByYear.Key,
             TotalValue = salesByYear.Sum()
           };
```

LINQ’s grouping is more powerful than SQL’s GROUP BY in that you can fetch all detail rows without any aggregation:

from p in dbContext.Purchases
group p by p.Date.Year
Date.Year
However, this doesn’t work in EF Core. An easy workaround is to call .AsEnumerable() just before grouping so that the grouping happens on the client. This is no less efficient as long as you perform any filtering before grouping so that you only fetch the data you need from the server.

Another departure from traditional SQL comes in there being no obligation to project the variables or expressions used in grouping or sorting.

# Grouping by multiple keys
You can group by a composite key, using an anonymous type:

from n in names
group n by new { FirstLetter = n[0], Length = n.Length };
Custom equality comparers
You can pass a custom equality comparer into GroupBy, in a local query, to change the algorithm for key comparison. Rarely is this required, though, because changing the key selector expression is usually sufficient. For instance, the following creates a case-insensitive grouping:

group n by n.ToUpper()
