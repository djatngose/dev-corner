# Deferred Execution

An important feature of most query operators is that they execute not when constructed but when enumerated (in other words, when MoveNext is called on its enumerator). Consider the following query:
```c#
var numbers = new List<int> { 1 };

IEnumerable<int> query = numbers.Select (n => n \* 10); // Build query

numbers.Add (2); // Sneak in an extra element

foreach (int n in query)
Console.Write (n + "|"); // 10|20|\
```
The extra number that we sneaked into the list after constructing the query is included in the result because it’s not until the foreach statement runs that any filtering or sorting takes place. This is called deferred or lazy execution and is the same as what happens with delegates:

All standard query operators provide deferred execution: `Select, Where, Take, Skip, SkipWhile, TakeWhile,GroupBy,Join,GroupJoin, Zip`
These query operators return an IEnumerable<T> or an IQueryable<T> type which represents the query and is not actually executed until an action is performed that triggers the execution, such as with the following `exceptions`: 
  - Operators that return a single element or scalar value, such as `First or Count`
  - The following conversion operators: `ToArray, ToList, ToDictionary, ToLookup, ToHashSet`
  These operators cause immediate query execution because their result types have no mechanism to provide deferred execution. The Count method, for instance, returns a simple integer, which doesn’t then get enumerated. The following query is executed immediately:
```c#
int matches = numbers.Where (n => n <= 2).Count(); // 1
```
This deferred execution allows for efficient query execution as the query is not executed until it is actually needed.
Deferred execution is important because it `decouples query construction from query execution`. This allows you to construct a query in several steps and also makes database queries possible.

`NOTE`
Subqueries provide another level of indirection. Everything in a subquery is subject to deferred execution, including aggregation and conversion methods. 

# Are IList, ICollection, IDictionary represents query is not actually executed?
IList<T> and ICollection<T> interfaces do not represent deferred execution of a LINQ query. They represent a collection of objects that have already been loaded into memory.

When you execute a LINQ query, the query operators return an IEnumerable<T> or an IQueryable<T> type that represents the query and does not actually execute the query yet. Once you perform an action on the IEnumerable<T> or IQueryable<T> type, such as iterating over it or calling a method like ToList(), ToArray(), Count(), or First(), the query is executed, and the result is loaded into memory as an IList<T> or ICollection<T>.

So, IList<T> and ICollection<T> represent a collection of objects that have already been loaded into memory, whereas IEnumerable<T> and IQueryable<T> represent the query that is not executed yet and can provide deferred execution

# Reevaluation
Deferred execution has another consequence: a deferred execution query is reevaluated when you reenumerate:
```c#
var numbers = new List<int>() { 1, 2 };

IEnumerable<int> query = numbers.Select (n => n * 10);
foreach (int n in query) Console.Write (n + "|");   // 10|20|

numbers.Clear();
foreach (int n in query) Console.Write (n + "|");   // <nothing>
```

There are a couple of reasons why `reevaluation is sometimes disadvantageous:`
  - Sometimes, you want to `freeze` or `cache` the results at a certain point in time.
  - Some `queries are computationally intensive (or rely on querying a remote database)`, so you don’t want to unnecessarily repeat them.

You can `defeat reevaluation by calling a conversion operator such as ToArray or ToList`. ToArray copies the output of a query to an array; ToList copies to a generic List<T>:

```c#
var numbers = new List<int>() { 1, 2 };

List<int> timesTen = numbers
  .Select (n => n * 10)
  .ToList();                // Executes immediately into a List<int>

numbers.Clear();
Console.WriteLine (timesTen.Count);      // Still 2
``` 
# Captured Variables
If your query’s lambda expressions capture outer variables, the query will honor the value of those variables at the time the query runs:
```c#
int[] numbers = { 1, 2 };

int factor = 10;
IEnumerable<int> query = numbers.Select (n => n * factor);
factor = 20;
foreach (int n in query) Console.Write (n + "|");   // 20|40|
```

```c#
var results = new List<int>();
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
    results.Add(() => i);
}
foreach (var result in results)
{
    Console.WriteLine(result());
}

```
In this example, the loop variable i is captured by the lambda expression and is evaluated when the lambda expression is executed, not when it is created. The output of this code will be ten 9s, not the numbers from 0 to 9 as might be expected.
To fix this issue, you can create a local variable inside the loop to store the current value of i:
```c#
var results = new List<int>();
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
    int j = i; // create a local variable to store the current value of i
    results.Add(() => j);
}
foreach (var result in results)
{
    Console.WriteLine(result());
}

```
Another example
```c#
int number = 5;
var query = Enumerable.Range(1, 10)
                       .Where(x => x > number)
                       .Select(x => x * number);
number = 10;
foreach (var result in query)
{
    Console.WriteLine(result);
}
//OUTPUT
50
55
60
65
70

```
In this example, the variable number is captured by the lambda expression in the Select method. When the query is executed, the value of number is 10, which is the value that will be used to calculate the result of the lambda expression for each element in the query.

To fix this issue, you can create a local variable inside the query to store the original value of number:

```c#
int number = 5;
var query = Enumerable.Range(1, 10)
                       .Where(x => x > number)
                       .Select(x =>
                       {
                           int temp = number;
                           return x * temp;
                       });
number = 10;
foreach (var result in query)
{
    Console.WriteLine(result);
}

```
This can be a trap when building up a query within a for loop. For example, suppose that we want to remove all vowels from a string. The following, although inefficient, gives the correct result:
```c#
IEnumerable<char> query = "Not what you might expect";

query = query.Where (c => c != 'a');
query = query.Where (c => c != 'e');
query = query.Where (c => c != 'i');
query = query.Where (c => c != 'o');
query = query.Where (c => c != 'u');

foreach (char c in query) Console.Write (c);  // Nt wht y mght xpct
```
Now watch what happens when we refactor this with a for loop:
```c#
IEnumerable<char> query = "Not what you might expect";
string vowels = "aeiou";

for (int i = 0; i < vowels.Length; i++)
  query = query.Where (c => c != vowels[i]); //IndexOutOfRangeException will be thrown

foreach (char c in query) Console.Write (c);
```

An IndexOutOfRangeException is thrown upon enumerating the query because, as we saw in Chapter 4 (see “Capturing Outer Variables”), the compiler scopes the iteration variable in the for loop as if it were declared outside the loop. Hence, each closure captures the same variable (i) whose value is 5 when the query is actually enumerated. To solve this, you must assign the loop variable to another variable declared inside the statement block:
```c#
for (int i = 0; i < vowels.Length; i++)
{
  char vowel = vowels[i];
  query = query.Where (c => c != vowel);
}
```
This forces a fresh local variable to be captured on each loop iteration.

`NOTE`
Another way to solve the problem is to `replace the for loop with a foreach loop`:
```c#
foreach (char vowel in vowels)
  query = query.Where (c => c != vowel);
```
# How Deferred Execution Works
Query operators provide `deferred execution` by returning `decorator sequences`.

Unlike a traditional collection class such as an array or linked list, a `decorator sequence` (in general) has no backing structure of its own to store elements. Instead, it wraps another sequence that you supply at runtime, to which it maintains a permanent dependency. Whenever you request data from a decorator, it in turn must request data from the wrapped input sequence.

`NOTE`
The query operator’s transformation constitutes the “decoration.” If the output sequence performed no transformation, it would be a proxy rather than a decorator. The "query operator’s transformation" in this context refers to the specific transformation applied to the data sequence by a LINQ query operator such as `Select, Where, OrderBy,` etc. This transformation can be seen as a decoration because it adds additional functionality or behavior to the original data sequence. This means that if the LINQ query did not perform any transformation on the data sequence, the resulting output sequence would simply act as a proxy for the original data sequence without adding any additional functionality or behavior. In this case, the query would not be considered a decorator.

Calling `Where` merely constructs the decorator wrapper sequence, which holds a reference to the input sequence, the lambda expression, and any other arguments supplied. The input sequence is enumerated only when the decorator is enumerated.

```c#
IEnumerable<int> lessThanTen = new int[] { 5, 12, 3 }.Where (n => n < 10);
```
https://learning.oreilly.com/api/v2/epubs/urn:orm:book:9781098121945/files/assets/cn10_0803.png

When you enumerate lessThanTen, you are, in effect, querying the array through the Where decorator.

The good news—should you ever want to write `your own query operator—is that implementing a decorator sequence `is easy with a C# iterator. Here’s how you can write your own Select method:

```c#
public static IEnumerable<TResult> MySelect<TSource,TResult>
  (this IEnumerable<TSource> source, Func<TSource,TResult> selector)
{
  foreach (TSource element in source)
    yield return selector (element);
}
```
This method is an iterator by virtue of the yield return statement. Functionally, it’s a shortcut for the following:

public static IEnumerable<TResult> MySelect<TSource,TResult>
  (this IEnumerable<TSource> source, Func<TSource,TResult> selector)
{
  return new SelectSequence (source, selector);
}
where SelectSequence is a (compiler-written) class whose enumerator encapsulates the logic in the iterator method.

Hence, when you call an operator such as Select or Where, you’re doing nothing more than instantiating an enumerable class that decorates the input sequence.

# Chaining Decorators
Chaining query operators creates a layering of decorators. Consider the following query:
```c#
IEnumerable<int> query = new int[] { 5, 12, 3 }.Where   (n => n < 10)
                                               .OrderBy (n => n)
                                               .Select  (n => n * 10);
```
Each query operator instantiates a new decorator that wraps the previous sequence (rather like a Russian nesting doll)

When you enumerate query, you’re querying the original array, transformed through a layering or chain of decorators.

`NOTE`
Adding ToList onto the end of this query would cause the preceding operators to execute immediately, collapsing the whole object model into a single list.
shows the same object composition in Unified Modeling Language (UML) syntax. Select’s decorator references the OrderBy decorator, which references Where’s decorator, which references the array. A feature of deferred execution is that you build the identical object model if you compose the query progressively:
```c#
IEnumerable<int>
  source    = new int[] { 5, 12, 3 },
  filtered  = source   .Where   (n => n < 10),
  sorted    = filtered .OrderBy (n => n),
  query     = sorted   .Select  (n => n * 10);
  ```

# How Queries Are Executed
Here are the results of enumerating the preceding query:
```c#
foreach (int n in query) Console.WriteLine (n);

30
50
```
Behind the scenes, `the foreach calls GetEnumerator on Select’s decorator` (the last or outermost operator), which kicks off everything. The result is a chain of enumerators that structurally mirrors the chain of decorator sequences. Figure 8-6 illustrates the flow of execution as enumeration proceeds.

# Double deferred execution
With local queries, you get double-deferred execution, because from a functional perspective, you’re selecting a sequence of queries. So, if you enumerate the outer result sequence but never enumerate the inner sequences, the subquery will never execute." Can you write example with local queries linq not from EF
```c#
var numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };

var query = from number in numbers
            select new
            {
                Number = number,
                Doubled = from innerNumber in numbers // nerver executed until enumeration
                          select innerNumber * 2
            };

foreach (var item in query)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Number: {item.Number}");
}

```
In this example, we have a local query that selects each number in a list, and creates an anonymous object that contains the original number and a subquery that doubles each number in the list. However, notice that we only enumerate the outer result sequence (using the foreach loop), but we never enu merate the inner subqueries. As a result, the subquery that doubles the numbers is never executed.
