# Subqueries
A subquery is a query contained within another query’s lambda expression. The following example uses a subquery to sort musicians by their last name:
```c#
string[] musos = 
  { "David Gilmour", "Roger Waters", "Rick Wright", "Nick Mason" };

IEnumerable<string> query = musos.OrderBy (m => m.Split().Last());
```
m.Split converts each string into a collection of words, upon which we then call the Last query operator. m.Split().Last is the subquery; query references the outer query.

Subqueries are permitted because you can put any valid C# expression on the righthand side of a lambda. A subquery is simply another C# expression. This means that the rules for subqueries are a consequence of the rules for lambda expressions (and the behavior of query operators in general).

`NOTE`
The term subquery, in the general sense, has a broader meaning. For the purpose of describing LINQ, we use the term only for a query referenced from within the lambda expression of another query. In a query expression, a subquery amounts to a query referenced from an expression in any clause except the from clause.

A subquery is privately scoped to the enclosing expression and can reference parameters in the outer lambda expression (or range variables in a query expression).

m.Split().Last is a very simple subquery. The next query retrieves all strings in an array whose length matches that of the shortest string:
```c#
string[] names = { "Tom", "Dick", "Harry", "Mary", "Jay" };

IEnumerable<string> outerQuery = names
  .Where (n => n.Length == names.OrderBy (n2 => n2.Length)
                                .Select  (n2 => n2.Length).First());

// Tom, Jay
```
Here’s the same thing as a query expression:

IEnumerable<string> outerQuery =
  from   n in names
  where  n.Length ==
           (from n2 in names orderby n2.Length select n2.Length).First()
  select n;
Because `the outer range variable (n) is in scope for a subquery, we cannot reuse n as the subquery’s range variable.`

A subquery is executed whenever the enclosing lambda expression is evaluated. This means that a subquery is executed upon demand, at the discretion of the outer query. You could say that execution proceeds from the outside in. Local queries follow this model literally; interpreted queries (e.g., database queries) follow this model conceptually.

We can express our preceding subquery more succinctly as follows:
```c#
IEnumerable<string> query =
  from   n in names
  where  n.Length == names.OrderBy (n2 => n2.Length).First().Length
  select n;
With the Min aggregation function, we can simplify the query further:

IEnumerable<string> query =
  from   n in names
  where  n.Length == names.Min (n2 => n2.Length)
  select n;
```
In “Interpreted Queries”, we describe how remote sources such as SQL tables can be queried. Our example makes an ideal database query because it would be processed as a unit, requiring only one round trip to the database server. This query, however, is `inefficient for a local collection because the subquery is recalculated on each outer loop iteration`. We can `avoid this inefficiency by running the subquery separately` (so that it’s no longer a subquery):

```c#
int shortest = names.Min (n => n.Length);

IEnumerable<string> query = from   n in names
                            where  n.Length == shortest
                            select n;
```

`NOTE`
Factoring out subqueries in this manner is nearly always desirable when querying local collections. An exception is when the subquery is correlated, meaning that it references the outer range variable. We explore correlated subqueries in `Projecting`.

# Subqueries and Deferred Execution
An element or aggregation operator such as `First or Count` in a subquery doesn’t force the outer query into immediate execution—deferred execution still holds for the outer query. This is because subqueries are called indirectly—through a delegate in the case of a local query, or through an expression tree in the case of an interpreted query.

An interesting case arises when you include a subquery within a Select expression. In the case of a local query, you’re actually projecting a sequence of queries—each itself subject to deferred execution. The effect is generally transparent, and it serves to further improve efficiency.

`This means that if a subquery is expensive to compute, it will not be executed until it is absolutely necessary, which can improve the overall performance of the query`. Subqueries allow for complex filtering, aggregation, and transformation operations on a subset of data, while deferred execution delays the execution of a query until the results are actually needed, which can improve performance and memory management.

```c#
// define our data source
List<Customer> customers = GetCustomers();

// define the query using a subquery to filter by total order value
var query = from customer in customers
            where (from order in customer.Orders
                   select order.TotalValue).Sum() > 100
            select customer;

// iterate over the results (this is where the query is actually executed)
foreach (var customer in query)
{
    Console.WriteLine("Customer {0} has orders with a total value greater than $100", customer.Name);
}

```
In this example, the subquery (from order in customer.Orders select order.TotalValue).Sum() calculates the total value of all orders placed by a given customer. This subquery is not executed until the main query is enumerated, which happens when we iterate over the query variable in the foreach loop.

The use of deferred execution allows us to write a more complex query without incurring unnecessary overhead, because the subquery is only executed for customers who meet the criteria specified in the where clause. This can improve performance and reduce memory usage when working with large datasets.
