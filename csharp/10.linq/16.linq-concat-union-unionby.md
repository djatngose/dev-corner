# Concat, Union, and UnionBy
Concat returns all the elements of the first sequence, followed by all the elements of the second. Union does the same but removes any duplicates:

int[] seq1 = { 1, 2, 3 }, seq2 = { 3, 4, 5 };

IEnumerable<int>
  concat = seq1.Concat (seq2),    //  { 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5 }
  union  = seq1.Union  (seq2);    //  { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 }
Specifying the type argument explicitly is useful when the sequences are differently typed but the elements have a common base type. For instance, with the reflection API (Chapter 18), methods and properties are represented with MethodInfo and PropertyInfo classes, which have a common base class called MemberInfo. We can concatenate methods and properties by stating that base class explicitly when calling Concat:

MethodInfo[] methods = typeof (string).GetMethods();
PropertyInfo[] props = typeof (string).GetProperties();
IEnumerable<MemberInfo> both = methods.Concat<MemberInfo> (props);
In the next example, we filter the methods before concatenating:

var methods = typeof (string).GetMethods().Where (m => !m.IsSpecialName);
var props = typeof (string).GetProperties();
var both = methods.Concat<MemberInfo> (props);
This example relies on interface type parameter variance: methods is of type IEnumerable<MethodInfo>, which requires a covariant conversion to IEnumerable​<Mem⁠berInfo>. It’s a good illustration of how variance makes things work more like you’d expect.

# UnionBy 
(introduced in .NET 6) takes a keySelector, which is used in determining whether an element is a duplicate. In the following example, we perform a case-insensitive union:
```c#
string[] seq1 = { "A", "b", "C" };
string[] seq2 = { "a", "B", "c" };
var union = seq1.UnionBy (seq2, x => x.ToUpperInvariant());
// union is { "A", "b", "C" }
```
UnionBy (introduced in .NET 6) takes a keySelector, which is used in determining whether an element is a duplicate. In the following example, we perform a case-insensitive union:
```c#
string[] seq1 = { "A", "b", "C" };
string[] seq2 = { "a", "B", "c" };
var union = seq1.UnionBy (seq2, x => x.ToUpperInvariant());
// union is { "A", "b", "C" }
```
In this case, the same thing can be accomplished with Union, if we supply an equality comparer:
```c#
var union = seq1.Union (seq2, StringComparer.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase);
```
