# Intersect, Intersect By, Except, and ExceptBy
Intersect returns the elements that two sequences have in common. Except returns the elements in the first input sequence that are not present in the second:
```c#
int[] seq1 = { 1, 2, 3 }, seq2 = { 3, 4, 5 };

IEnumerable<int>
  commonality = seq1.Intersect (seq2),    //  { 3 }
  difference1 = seq1.Except    (seq2),    //  { 1, 2 }
  difference2 = seq2.Except    (seq1);    //  { 4, 5 }
  ```
Enumerable.Except works internally by loading all of the elements in the first collection into a dictionary and then removing from the dictionary all elements present in the second sequence. The equivalent in SQL is a NOT EXISTS or NOT IN subquery:
```c#
SELECT number FROM numbers1Table
WHERE number NOT IN (SELECT number FROM numbers2Table)
```
The IntersectBy and ExceptBy methods (from .NET 6) let you specify a key selector thatâ€™s applied before performing equality comparison (see the discussion on UnionBy in the preceding section).
