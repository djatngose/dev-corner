`Overview`
`With Select, you always get the same number of elements that you started with. Each element, however, can be transformed in any manner by the lambda function.`

The following selects the names of all fonts installed on the computer (from System.Drawing):
```c#
IEnumerable<string> query = from f in FontFamily.Families
                            select f.Name;

foreach (string name in query) Console.WriteLine (name);
```
In this example, the select clause converts a FontFamily object to its name. Here’s the lambda equivalent:
```c#
IEnumerable<string> query = FontFamily.Families.Select (f => f.Name);
```
Select statements are often used to project into anonymous types:
```c#
var query =
  from f in FontFamily.Families
  select new { f.Name, LineSpacing = f.GetLineSpacing (FontStyle.Bold) };
```
A projection with no transformation is sometimes used with query syntax to satisfy the requirement that the query end in a select or group clause. The following selects fonts supporting strikeout:
```c#
IEnumerable<FontFamily> query =
  from f in FontFamily.Families
  where f.IsStyleAvailable (FontStyle.Strikeout)
  select f;

foreach (FontFamily ff in query) Console.WriteLine (ff.Name);
```
In such cases, the compiler omits the projection when translating to fluent syntax.

#  Indexed projection
The selector expression can optionally accept an integer argument, which acts as an indexer, providing the expression with the position of each input in the input sequence. This works only with local queries:

string[] names = { "Tom", "Dick", "Harry", "Mary", "Jay" };

IEnumerable<string> query = names
  .Select ((s,i) => i + "=" + s);     //  { "0=Tom", "1=Dick", ... }
Select subqueries and object hierarchies
You can nest a subquery in a select clause to build an object hierarchy. The following example returns a collection describing each directory under Path.GetTempPath(), with a subcollection of files under each directory:

string tempPath = Path.GetTempPath();
DirectoryInfo[] dirs = new DirectoryInfo (tempPath).GetDirectories();

var query =
  from d in dirs
  where (d.Attributes & FileAttributes.System) == 0
  select new
  {
    DirectoryName = d.FullName,
    Created = d.CreationTime,

    Files = from f in d.GetFiles()
            where (f.Attributes & FileAttributes.Hidden) == 0
            select new { FileName = f.Name, f.Length, }
  };

foreach (var dirFiles in query)
{
  Console.WriteLine ("Directory: " + dirFiles.DirectoryName);
  foreach (var file in dirFiles.Files)
    Console.WriteLine ("  " + file.FileName + " Len: " + file.Length);
}
The inner portion of this query can be called a correlated subquery. A subquery is correlated if it references an object in the outer query—in this case, it references d, the directory being enumerated.

A subquery inside a Select allows you to map one object hierarchy to another, or map a relational object model to a hierarchical object model.

`With local queries, a subquery within a Select causes double-deferred execution`. In our example, the files aren’t filtered or projected until the inner foreach statement enumerates.

# Subqueries and joins in EF Core
`Subquery projections work well in EF Core, and you can use them to do the work of SQL-style joins`. Here’s how we retrieve each customer’s name along with their high-value purchases:

var query =
  from c in dbContext.Customers
  select new {
               c.Name,
               Purchases = (from p in dbContext.Purchases
                           where p.CustomerID == c.ID && p.Price > 1000
                           select new { p.Description, p.Price })
                           .ToList()
             };

foreach (var namePurchases in query)
{
  Console.WriteLine ("Customer: " + namePurchases.Name);
  foreach (var purchaseDetail in namePurchases.Purchases)
    Console.WriteLine ("  - $$$: " + purchaseDetail.Price);
}
NOTE
Note the use of ToList in the subquery. EF Core 3 cannot create queryables from the subquery result when that subquery references the DbContext. This issue is being tracked by the EF Core team and might be resolved in a future release.

This style of query is ideally suited to interpreted queries. The outer query and subquery are processed as a unit, preventing unnecessary round-tripping. With local queries, however, it’s inefficient because every combination of outer and inner elements must be enumerated to get the few matching combinations. A better choice for local queries is Join or GroupJoin, described in the following sections.

This query matches up objects from two disparate collections, and it can be thought of as a “join.” The difference between this and a conventional database join (or subquery) is that we’re not flattening the output into a single two-dimensional result set. We’re mapping the relational data to hierarchical data, rather than to flat data.

Here’s the same query simplified by using the Purchases collection navigation property on the Customer entity:

from c in dbContext.Customers
select new
{
  c.Name,
  Purchases = from p in c.Purchases    // Purchases is List<Purchase>
              where p.Price > 1000
              select new { p.Description, p.Price }
};

`Both queries are analogous to a left outer join in SQL in the sense that we get all customers in the outer enumeratio`n, regardless of whether they have any purchases. To emulate an inner join—whereby customers without high-value purchases are excluded—we would need to add a filter condition on the purchases collection:
```c#
from c in dbContext.Customers
where c.Purchases.Any (p => p.Price > 1000)
select new {
             c.Name,
             Purchases = from p in c.Purchases
                         where p.Price > 1000
                         select new { p.Description, p.Price }
           };
```
This style of query is flexible. By changing Any to Count, for instance, we can modify the query to retrieve only customers with at least two high-value purchases:
```c#
...
where highValueP.Count() >= 2
select new { c.Name, Purchases = highValueP };
```

# Projecting into concrete types
In the examples so far, we’ve instantiated anonymous types in the output. It can also be useful to instantiate (ordinary) named classes, which you populate with object initializers. Such classes can include custom logic and can be passed between methods and assemblies without using type information.

A typical example is a custom business entity. A custom business entity is simply a class that you write with some properties but is designed to hide lower-level (database-related) details. You might exclude foreign key fields from business-entity classes, for instance. Assuming that we wrote custom entity classes called CustomerEntity and PurchaseEntity, here’s how we could project into them:

```c#
IQueryable<CustomerEntity> query =
  from c in dbContext.Customers
  select new CustomerEntity
  {
    Name = c.Name,
    Purchases =
      (from p in c.Purchases
       where p.Price > 1000
       select new PurchaseEntity {
                                   Description = p.Description,
                                   Value = p.Price
                                 }
      ).ToList()
  };

// Force query execution, converting output to a more convenient List:
List<CustomerEntity> result = query.ToList();
```

`NOTE`
When created to transfer data between tiers in a program or between separate systems, custom business entity classes are often called data transfer objects (DTO). DTOs contain no business logic.

Notice that so far, we’ve not had to use a Join or SelectMany statement. This is because we’re maintaining the hierarchical shape of the data, as illustrated in Figure 9-2. With LINQ, you can often avoid the traditional SQL approach of flattening tables into a two-dimensional result set.
