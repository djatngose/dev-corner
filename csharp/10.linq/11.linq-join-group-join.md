# Joining
`Join`	Applies a lookup strategy to match elements from two collections, emitting a flat result set	INNER JOIN
`GroupJoin`	Similar to Join, but emits a hierarchical result set	INNER JOIN,LEFT OUTER JOIN
`Zip`	Enumerates two sequences in step (like a zipper), applying a function over each element pair	Exception thrown

# Overview
`Join and GroupJoin` mesh two input sequences into a single output sequence. Join emits flat output; GroupJoin emits hierarchical output.

`Join and GroupJoin` provide an alternative strategy to Select and SelectMany. The advantage of Join and GroupJoin is that they execute efficiently over local in-memory collections because they first load the inner sequence into a keyed lookup, avoiding the need to repeatedly enumerate over every inner element. The disadvantage is that they offer the equivalent of inner and left outer joins only; cross joins and non-equi joins must still be done using Select/SelectMany. With EF Core queries, Join and GroupJoin offer no real benefits over Select and SelectMany.

# Join
The Join operator performs an inner join, emitting a flat output sequence.

The following query lists all customers alongside their purchases without using a navigation property:
```c#
IQueryable<string> query =
  from c in dbContext.Customers
  join p in dbContext.Purchases on c.ID equals p.CustomerID
  select c.Name + " bought a " + p.Description;
```
The results match what we would get from a SelectMany-style query:
```c#
Tom bought a Bike
Tom bought a Holiday
Dick bought a Phone
Harry bought a Car
```
# Join vs SelectMany
To see the `benefit of Join over SelectMany`, we must convert this to a local query. We can demonstrate this by first copying all customers and purchases to arrays and then querying the arrays:
```c#
Customer[] customers = dbContext.Customers.ToArray();
Purchase[] purchases = dbContext.Purchases.ToArray();
var slowQuery = from c in customers
                from p in purchases where c.ID == p.CustomerID
                select c.Name + " bought a " + p.Description;

var fastQuery = from c in customers
                join p in purchases on c.ID equals p.CustomerID
                select c.Name + " bought a " + p.Description;
```
Although both queries yield the same results, `the Join query is considerably faster because its implementation in Enumerable preloads the inner collection (purchases) into a keyed lookup`.

The query syntax for join can be written in general terms, as follows:
```c#
join inner-var in inner-sequence on outer-key-expr equals inner-key-expr
```
Join operators in LINQ differentiate between the outer sequence and inner sequence. Syntactically:
  - The outer sequence is the input sequence (customers, in this case).
  - The inner sequence is the new collection you introduce (purchases, in this case).

Join performs inner joins, meaning customers without purchases are excluded from the output. With inner joins, you can swap the inner and outer sequences in the query and still get the same results:
```c#
from p in purchases                                // p is now outer
join c in customers on p.CustomerID equals c.ID    // c is now inner
...
```
You can add further join clauses to the same query. If each purchase, for instance, has one or more purchase items, you could join the purchase items, as follows:
```c#
from c in customers
join p in purchases on c.ID equals p.CustomerID           // first join
join pi in purchaseItems on p.ID equals pi.PurchaseID     // second join
...
```
purchases acts as the inner sequence in the first join and as the outer sequence in the second join. You could obtain the same results (inefficiently) using nested foreach statements, as follows:
```c#
foreach (Customer c in customers)
  foreach (Purchase p in purchases)
    if (c.ID == p.CustomerID)
      foreach (PurchaseItem pi in purchaseItems)
        if (p.ID == pi.PurchaseID)
          Console.WriteLine (c.Name + "," + p.Price + "," + pi.Detail);
```        
In query syntax, variables from earlier joins remain in scope—just as they do with SelectMany-style queries. You’re also permitted to insert where and let clauses in between join clauses.

# Join works behind the scene
Let's say we have two collections, customers and orders, and we want to join them on the CustomerId field to retrieve a list of tuples that contains the customer name and the order description.

```c#
var customers = new List<Customer>
{
    new Customer { CustomerId = 1, Name = "John" },
    new Customer { CustomerId = 2, Name = "Jane" },
    new Customer { CustomerId = 3, Name = "Mike" },
};

var orders = new List<Order>
{
    new Order { OrderId = 1, CustomerId = 1, Description = "Order 1" },
    new Order { OrderId = 2, CustomerId = 2, Description = "Order 2" },
    new Order { OrderId = 3, CustomerId = 3, Description = "Order 3" },
};
```
We can perform a join operation using the LINQ join keyword, like this:

```c#
var result = from customer in customers
             join order in orders
             on customer.CustomerId equals order.CustomerId
             select (customer.Name, order.Description);
```
Behind the scenes, the LINQ engine would perform the following steps:

Identify the join condition: The engine identifies the join condition by looking at the on clause in the LINQ query. In this case, the join condition is customer.CustomerId equals order.CustomerId.

Build a hash table: The engine builds a hash table to store the values in the orders collection. This hash table allows the engine to quickly locate matching records based on the join condition.

Iterate over the customers collection: The engine iterates over the customers collection and retrieves the CustomerId value for each record.

Use the hash table to locate matching records: For each CustomerId value, the engine uses the hash table to quickly locate all matching records in the orders collection based on the join condition.

Create a new record for each match: For each matching record, the engine creates a new record that contains the customer name and order description.

Return the result: The engine returns the list of new records as the result of the query.

This approach is more efficient than manually performing nested loops because the engine can use indexing and hash tables to quickly locate matching records and avoid scanning the entire collection.

# Joining on multiple keys
You can join on multiple keys with anonymous types, as follows:
```c#
from x in sequenceX
join y in sequenceY on new { K1 = x.Prop1, K2 = x.Prop2 }
                equals new { K1 = y.Prop3, K2 = y.Prop4 }
...
```
For this to work, the two anonymous types must be structured identically. The compiler then implements each with the same internal type, making the joining keys compatible.

# Joining in fluent syntax
The following query syntax join
```c#
 from c in customers
 join p in purchases on c.ID equals p.CustomerID
 select new { c.Name, p.Description, p.Price };
 ```
in fluent syntax is as follows:
```c#
 customers.Join (                // outer collection
       purchases,                // inner collection
       c => c.ID,                // outer key selector
       p => p.CustomerID,        // inner key selector
       (c, p) => new
          { c.Name, p.Description, p.Price }    // result selector
 );
 ```
The result selector expression at the end creates each element in the output sequence. If you have additional clauses prior to projecting, such as orderby in this example:
```c#
from c in customers
join p in purchases on c.ID equals p.CustomerID
orderby p.Price
select c.Name + " bought a " + p.Description
```
you must manufacture a temporary anonymous type in the result selector in fluent syntax. This keeps both c and p in scope following the join:
```c#
customers.Join (                  // outer collection
      purchases,                  // inner collection
      c => c.ID,                  // outer key selector
      p => p.CustomerID,          // inner key selector
      (c, p) => new { c, p } )    // result selector
  .OrderBy (x => x.p.Price)
  .Select  (x => x.c.Name + " bought a " + x.p.Description);
```
Query syntax is usually preferable when joining; it’s less fiddly.

# GroupJoin
`GroupJoin` does the same work as Join, but instead of yielding a flat result, it yields a hierarchical result, grouped by each outer element. It also allows left outer joins. `GroupJoin is not currently supported in EF Core`.


The query syntax for GroupJoin is the same as for Join, but is followed by the into keyword.

Here’s the most basic example, using a local query:
```c#
Customer[] customers = dbContext.Customers.ToArray();
Purchase[] purchases = dbContext.Purchases.ToArray();

IEnumerable<IEnumerable<Purchase>> query =
  from c in customers
  join p in purchases on c.ID equals p.CustomerID
  into custPurchases
  select custPurchases;   // custPurchases is a sequence
```
`NOTE`
An into clause translates to GroupJoin only when it appears directly after a join clause. After a select or group clause, it means query continuation. The two uses of the into keyword are quite different, although they have one feature in common: they both introduce a new range variable.

he result is a sequence of sequences, which we could enumerate as follows:
```c#
foreach (IEnumerable<Purchase> purchaseSequence in query)
  foreach (Purchase p in purchaseSequence)
    Console.WriteLine (p.Description);
  ```
This isn’t very useful, however, because purchaseSequence has no reference to the customer. More commonly, you’d do this:
```c#
from c in customers
join p in purchases on c.ID equals p.CustomerID
into custPurchases
select new { CustName = c.Name, custPurchases };
```
This gives the same results as the following (inefficient) Select subquery:
```c#
from c in customers
select new
{
  CustName = c.Name,
  custPurchases = purchases.Where (p => c.ID == p.CustomerID)
};
```
By default, `GroupJoin does the equivalent of a left outer join`. To get an inner join—whereby customers without purchases are excluded—you need to filter on custPurchases:
```c#
from c in customers join p in purchases on c.ID equals p.CustomerID
into custPurchases
where custPurchases.Any()
select ...
```
Clauses after a group-join into operate on subsequences of inner child elements, not individual child elements. This means that to filter individual purchases, you’d need to call Where before joining:
```c#
from c in customers
join p in purchases.Where (p2 => p2.Price > 1000)
  on c.ID equals p.CustomerID
into custPurchases ...
```
You can construct lambda queries with GroupJoin as you would with Join.

# Flat outer joins
You run into a dilemma if you want both an outer join and a flat result set. GroupJoin gives you the outer join; Join gives you the flat result set. The solution is to first call GroupJoin, then DefaultIfEmpty on each child sequence, and then finally SelectMany on the result:
```c#
from c in customers
join p in purchases on c.ID equals p.CustomerID into custPurchases
from cp in custPurchases.DefaultIfEmpty()
select new
{
  CustName = c.Name,
  Price = cp == null ? (decimal?) null : cp.Price
};
```
`DefaultIfEmpty` emits a sequence with a single null value if a subsequence of purchases is empty. The second from clause translates to SelectMany. In this role, it expands and flattens all the purchase subsequences, concatenating them into a single sequence of purchase elements.

# Joining with lookups
The Join and GroupJoin methods in Enumerable work in two steps. First, they load the inner sequence into a lookup. Second, they query the outer sequence in combination with the lookup.

A lookup is a sequence of groupings that can be accessed directly by key. Another way to think of it is as a dictionary of sequences—a dictionary that can accept many elements under each key (sometimes called a multidictionary). Lookups are read-only and defined by the following interface:
```c#
public interface ILookup<TKey,TElement> :
   IEnumerable<IGrouping<TKey,TElement>>, IEnumerable
{
  int Count { get; }
  bool Contains (TKey key);
  IEnumerable<TElement> this [TKey key] { get; }
}
```
`NOTE`
The joining operators—like other sequence-emitting operators—honor deferred or lazy execution semantics. This means the lookup is not built until you begin enumerating the output sequence (and then the entire lookup is built right then).

You can create and query lookups manually as an alternative strategy to using the joining operators when dealing with local collections. There are a couple of benefits to doing so:
  - You can reuse the same lookup over multiple queries—as well as in ordinary imperative code.
  - Querying a lookup is an excellent way of understanding how Join and GroupJoin work.

The ToLookup extension method creates a `lookup`. The following loads all purchases into a lookup—keyed by their CustomerID:
```c#
ILookup<int?,Purchase> purchLookup =
  purchases.ToLookup (p => p.CustomerID, p => p);
```

The first argument selects the key; the second argument selects the objects that are to be loaded as values into the lookup.

Reading a lookup is rather like reading a dictionary except that the indexer returns a sequence of matching items rather than a single matching item. The following enumerates all purchases made by the customer whose ID is 1:
```c#
foreach (Purchase p in purchLookup [1])
  Console.WriteLine (p.Description);
```

With a lookup in place, you can write SelectMany/Select queries that execute as efficiently as Join/GroupJoin queries. Join is equivalent to using SelectMany on a lookup:
```c#
from c in customers
from p in purchLookup [c.ID]
select new { c.Name, p.Description, p.Price };

Tom Bike 500
Tom Holiday 2000
Dick Bike 600
Dick Phone 300
...
```
Adding a call to DefaultIfEmpty makes this into an outer join:
```c#
from c in customers
from p in purchLookup [c.ID].DefaultIfEmpty()
 select new {
              c.Name,
              Descript = p == null ? null : p.Description,
              Price = p == null ? (decimal?) null : p.Price
            };
```
GroupJoin is equivalent to reading the lookup inside a projection:
```c#
from c in customers
select new {
             CustName = c.Name,
             CustPurchases = purchLookup [c.ID]
           };
```

# Enumerable implementations
Here’s the simplest valid implementation of `Enumerable.Join`, null checking aside:
```C#
public static IEnumerable <TResult> Join
                                    <TOuter,TInner,TKey,TResult> (
  this IEnumerable <TOuter>     outer,
  IEnumerable <TInner>          inner,
  Func <TOuter,TKey>            outerKeySelector,
  Func <TInner,TKey>            innerKeySelector,
  Func <TOuter,TInner,TResult>  resultSelector)
{
  ILookup <TKey, TInner> lookup = inner.ToLookup (innerKeySelector);
  return
    from outerItem in outer
    from innerItem in lookup [outerKeySelector (outerItem)]
    select resultSelector (outerItem, innerItem);
}
```
`GroupJoin`’s implementation is like that of Join but simpler:

```c#
public static IEnumerable <TResult> GroupJoin
                                    <TOuter,TInner,TKey,TResult> (
  this IEnumerable <TOuter>     outer,
  IEnumerable <TInner>          inner,
  Func <TOuter,TKey>            outerKeySelector,
  Func <TInner,TKey>            innerKeySelector,
  Func <TOuter,IEnumerable<TInner>,TResult>  resultSelector)
{
  ILookup <TKey, TInner> lookup = inner.ToLookup (innerKeySelector);
  return
    from outerItem in outer
    select resultSelector
     (outerItem, lookup [outerKeySelector (outerItem)]);
}
```
