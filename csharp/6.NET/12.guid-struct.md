# The Guid Struct
The Guid struct represents a globally unique identifier: a 16-byte value that, when generated, is almost certainly unique in the world. Guids are often used for keys of various sorts, in applications and databases. There are 2128 or 3.4 Ã— 1038 unique Guids.

The static Guid.NewGuid method generates a unique Guid:

Guid g = Guid.NewGuid ();
Console.WriteLine (g.ToString());  // 0d57629c-7d6e-4847-97cb-9e2fc25083fe
To instantiate an existing value, you use one of the constructors. The two most useful constructors are:

public Guid (byte[] b);    // Accepts a 16-byte array
public Guid (string g);    // Accepts a formatted string
When represented as a string, a Guid is formatted as a 32-digit hexadecimal number, with optional hyphens after the 8th, 12th, 16th, and 20th digits. The whole string can also be optionally wrapped in brackets or braces:

Guid g1 = new Guid ("{0d57629c-7d6e-4847-97cb-9e2fc25083fe}");
Guid g2 = new Guid ("0d57629c7d6e484797cb9e2fc25083fe");
Console.WriteLine (g1 == g2);  // True
Being a struct, a Guid honors value-type semantics; hence, the equality operator works in the preceding example.

The ToByteArray method converts a Guid to a byte array.

The static Guid.Empty property returns an empty Guid (all zeros). This is often used in place of null.
