# String and Text Handling
# Char
A C# char represents a single Unicode character and aliases the System.Char struct. In Chapter 2, we described how to express char literals:

char c = 'A';
char newLine = '\n';
System.Char defines a range of static methods for working with characters, such as ToUpper, ToLower, and IsWhiteSpace. You can call these through either the System.Char type or its char alias:

Console.WriteLine (System.Char.ToUpper ('c'));    // C
Console.WriteLine (char.IsWhiteSpace ('\t'));     // True
ToUpper and ToLower honor the end user’s locale, which can lead to subtle bugs. The following expression evaluates to false in Turkey:

char.ToUpper ('i') == 'I'
The reason is because in Turkey, char.ToUpper ('i') is 'İ' (notice the dot on top!). To avoid this problem, System.Char (and System.String) also provides culture-invariant versions of ToUpper and ToLower ending with the word Invariant. These always apply English culture rules:

Console.WriteLine (char.ToUpperInvariant ('i'));    // I
This is a shortcut for:

Console.WriteLine (char.ToUpper ('i', CultureInfo.InvariantCulture))

# String
A C# string (== System.String) is an immutable (unchangeable) sequence of characters. In Chapter 2, we described how to express string literals, perform equality comparisons, and concatenate two strings. This section covers the remaining functions for working with strings, exposed through the static and instance members of the System.String class.

## Constructing strings
The simplest way to construct a string is to assign a literal, as we saw in Chapter 2:
```c#
string s1 = "Hello";
string s2 = "First Line\r\nSecond Line";
string s3 = @"\\server\fileshare\helloworld.cs";
```
To create a repeating sequence of characters, you can use string’s constructor:

Console.Write (new string ('*', 10));      // **********
You can also construct a string from a char array. The ToCharArray method does the reverse:
```c#
char[] ca = "Hello".ToCharArray();
string s = new string (ca);              // s = "Hello"
```
string’s constructor is also overloaded to accept various (unsafe) pointer types, in order to create strings from types such as char*.

## Null and empty strings
An empty string has a length of zero. To create an empty string, you can use either a literal or the static string.Empty field; to test for an empty string, you can either perform an equality comparison or test its Length property:

string empty = "";
Console.WriteLine (empty == "");              // True
Console.WriteLine (empty == string.Empty);    // True
Console.WriteLine (empty.Length == 0);        // True
Because strings are reference types, they can also be null:

string nullString = null;
Console.WriteLine (nullString == null);        // True
Console.WriteLine (nullString == "");          // False
Console.WriteLine (nullString.Length == 0);    // NullReferenceException
The static string.IsNullOrEmpty method is a useful shortcut for testing whether a given string is either null or empty.

## Accessing characters within a string
A string’s indexer returns a single character at the given index. As with all functions that operate on strings, this is zero-indexed:

string str  = "abcde";
char letter = str[1];        // letter == 'b'
string also implements IEnumerable<char>, so you can foreach over its characters:

foreach (char c in "123") Console.Write (c + ",");    // 1,2,3,

## Searching within strings
The simplest methods for searching within strings are StartsWith, EndsWith, and Contains. These all return true or false:

Console.WriteLine ("quick brown fox".EndsWith ("fox"));      // True
Console.WriteLine ("quick brown fox".Contains ("brown"));    // True
StartsWith and EndsWith are overloaded to let you specify a StringComparison enum or a CultureInfo object to control case and culture sensitivity (see “Ordinal versus culture comparison”). The default is to perform a case-sensitive match using rules applicable to the current (localized) culture. The following instead performs a case-insensitive search using the invariant culture’s rules:

"abcdef".StartsWith ("aBc", StringComparison.InvariantCultureIgnoreCase)
The Contains method doesn’t offer the convenience of this overload, although you can achieve the same result with the IndexOf method.

IndexOf is more powerful: it returns the first position of a given character or substring (or −1 if the substring isn’t found):

Console.WriteLine ("abcde".IndexOf ("cd"));   // 2
IndexOf is also overloaded to accept a startPosition (an index from which to begin searching) as well as a StringComparison enum:

Console.WriteLine ("abcde abcde".IndexOf ("CD", 6,
                   StringComparison.CurrentCultureIgnoreCase));    // 8
LastIndexOf is like IndexOf, but it works backward through the string.

IndexOfAny returns the first matching position of any one of a set of characters:

Console.Write ("ab,cd ef".IndexOfAny (new char[] {' ', ','} ));       // 2
Console.Write ("pas5w0rd".IndexOfAny ("0123456789".ToCharArray() ));  // 3

LastIndexOfAny does the same in the reverse direction.

# Manipulating strings
Because String is immutable, all the methods that “manipulate” a string return a new one, leaving the original untouched (the same goes for when you reassign a string variable).

Substring extracts a portion of a string:

string left3 = "12345".Substring (0, 3);     // left3 = "123";
string mid3  = "12345".Substring (1, 3);     // mid3 = "234";
If you omit the length, you get the remainder of the string:

string end3  = "12345".Substring (2);        // end3 = "345";
Insert and Remove insert or remove characters at a specified position:

string s1 = "helloworld".Insert (5, ", ");    // s1 = "hello, world"
string s2 = s1.Remove (5, 2);                 // s2 = "helloworld";
`PadLeft` and `PadRight` pad a string to a given length with a specified character (or a space if unspecified):

Console.WriteLine ("12345".PadLeft (9, '*'));  // ****12345
Console.WriteLine ("12345".PadLeft (9));       //     12345
If the input string is longer than the padding length, the original string is returned unchanged.

`TrimStart` and `TrimEnd` remove specified characters from the beginning or end of a string; Trim does both. By default, these functions remove whitespace characters (including spaces, tabs, new lines, and Unicode variations of these):

Console.WriteLine ("  abc \t\r\n ".Trim().Length);   // 3
`Replace` replaces all (nonoverlapping) occurrences of a particular character or substring:

Console.WriteLine ("to be done".Replace (" ", " | ") );  // to | be | done
Console.WriteLine ("to be done".Replace (" ", "")    );  // tobedone
ToUpper and ToLower return uppercase and lowercase versions of the input string. By default, they honor the user’s current language settings; ToUpperInvariant and ToLowerInvariant always apply English alphabet rules.

# Splitting and joining strings
Split divides a string into pieces:

string[] words = "The quick brown fox".Split();

foreach (string word in words)
  Console.Write (word + "|");    // The|quick|brown|fox|
By default, `Split` uses whitespace characters as delimiters; it’s also overloaded to accept a params array of char or string delimiters. Split also optionally accepts a StringSplitOptions enum, which has an option to remove empty entries: this is useful when words are separated by several delimiters in a row.

The static Join method does the reverse of Split. It requires a delimiter and string array:

string[] words = "The quick brown fox".Split();
string together = string.Join (" ", words);      // The quick brown fox
The static Concat method is similar to Join but accepts only a params string array and applies no separator. Concat is exactly equivalent to the + operator (the compiler, in fact, translates + to Concat):

string sentence     = string.Concat ("The", " quick", " brown", " fox");
string sameSentence = "The" + " quick" + " brown" + " fox";

# String.Format and composite format strings
The static Format method provides a convenient way to build strings that embed variables. The embedded variables (or values) can be of any type; the Format simply calls ToString on them.

The master string that includes the embedded variables is called a composite format string. When calling string.Format, you provide a composite format string followed by each of the embedded variables:

string composite = "It's {0} degrees in {1} on this {2} morning";
string s = string.Format (composite, 35, "Perth", DateTime.Now.DayOfWeek);

// s == "It's 35 degrees in Perth on this Friday morning"
(And that’s Celsius!)

We can use interpolated string literals to the same effect (see “String Type”). Just precede the string with the $ symbol and put the expressions in braces:

string s = $"It's hot this {DateTime.Now.DayOfWeek} morning";
Each number in curly braces is called a format item. The number corresponds to the argument position and is optionally followed by:

A comma and a minimum width to apply

A colon and a format string

The minimum width is useful for aligning columns. If the value is negative, the data is left-aligned; otherwise, it’s right-aligned:

string composite = "Name={0,-20} Credit Limit={1,15:C}";

Console.WriteLine (string.Format (composite, "Mary", 500));
Console.WriteLine (string.Format (composite, "Elizabeth", 20000));
Here’s the result:

Name=Mary                 Credit Limit=        $500.00
Name=Elizabeth            Credit Limit=     $20,000.00
Here’s the equivalent without using string.Format:

string s = "Name=" + "Mary".PadRight (20) +
           " Credit Limit=" + 500.ToString ("C").PadLeft (15);
The credit limit is formatted as currency by virtue of the "C" format string. We describe format strings in detail in “Formatting and Parsing”.

# Comparing Strings
In comparing two values, .NET differentiates the concepts of equality comparison and order comparison. Equality comparison tests whether two instances are semantically the same; order comparison tests which of two (if any) instances comes first when arranging them in ascending or descending sequence.


Ordinal versus culture comparison
There are two basic algorithms for string comparison: ordinal and culture sensitive. Ordinal comparisons interpret characters simply as numbers (according to their numeric Unicode value); culture-sensitive comparisons interpret characters with reference to a particular alphabet. There are two special cultures: the “current culture,” which is based on settings picked up from the computer’s control panel, and the “invariant culture,” which is the same on every computer (and closely matches American culture).

For equality comparison, both ordinal and culture-specific algorithms are useful. For ordering, however, culture-specific comparison is nearly always preferable: to order strings alphabetically, you need an alphabet. Ordinal relies on the numeric Unicode point values, which happen to put English characters in alphabetical order—but even then, not exactly as you might expect. For example, assuming case sensitivity, consider the strings "Atom", "atom", and "Zamia". The invariant culture puts them in the following order:

"atom", "Atom", "Zamia"
`Ordinal arranges` them instead as follows:

"Atom", "Zamia", "atom"
This is because the invariant culture encapsulates an alphabet, which considers uppercase characters adjacent to their lowercase counterparts (`aAbBcCdD...)`. The ordinal algorithm, however, puts all the uppercase characters first and then all lowercase characters `(A...Z, a...z)`. This is essentially a throwback to the ASCII character set invented in the 1960s.

Ordinal comparison and culture comparison are two ways to compare strings in .NET. Ordinal comparison compares strings using their Unicode character code points, without regard to the current culture settings. Culture comparison, on the other hand, considers cultural differences such as case sensitivity, diacritic marks, and sorting order.
`The default sorting behavior in .NET is culture-sensitive`

Here are some examples of how these two types of string comparison differ:

`Example 1: Case sensitivity`

vbnet
Copy code
string str1 = "hello";
string str2 = "HELLO";
bool ordinalEqual = String.Equals(str1, str2, StringComparison.Ordinal); // false
bool cultureEqual = String.Equals(str1, str2, StringComparison.CurrentCulture); // depends on the current culture
In this example, ordinalEqual is false because the ordinal comparison is case-sensitive, while cultureEqual may be true or false depending on the current culture's case sensitivity rules.

`Example 2: Diacritic marks`

vbnet
Copy code
string str1 = "resume";
string str2 = "résumé";
bool ordinalEqual = String.Equals(str1, str2, StringComparison.Ordinal); // false
bool cultureEqual = String.Equals(str1, str2, StringComparison.CurrentCulture); // true if the culture ignores diacritic marks
In this example, ordinalEqual is false because the ordinal comparison considers the diacritic marks as distinct characters, while cultureEqual may be true if the culture's comparison rules ignore diacritic marks.

`Example 3: Sorting order`

vbnet
Copy code
string str1 = "apple";
string str2 = "Banana";
bool ordinalEqual = String.Equals(str1, str2, StringComparison.Ordinal); // false
bool cultureEqual = String.Equals(str1, str2, StringComparison.CurrentCulture); // depends on the current culture's sorting order
In this example, ordinalEqual is false because the ordinal comparison compares the strings' characters according to their Unicode code points, while cultureEqual may be true or false depending on the current culture's sorting order rules.

In general, you should use culture comparison for user-facing strings and ordinal comparison for non-linguistic data such as filenames, XML elements, or enum values.

# String equality comparison
Despite ordinal’s limitations, string’s == operator always performs ordinal case-sensitive comparison. The same goes for the instance version of string.Equals when called without arguments; this defines the “default” equality comparison behavior for the string type.

NOTE
The ordinal algorithm was chosen for string’s == and Equals functions because it’s both highly efficient and deterministic. String equality comparison is considered fundamental and is performed far more frequently than order comparison.

A “strict” notion of equality is also consistent with the general use of the == operator.

The following methods allow culture-aware or case-insensitive comparisons:

public bool Equals(string value, StringComparison comparisonType);

public static bool Equals (string a, string b,
                           StringComparison comparisonType);
The static version is advantageous in that it still works if one or both of the strings are null. StringComparison is an enum defined as follows:
```c#
public enum StringComparison
{
  CurrentCulture,               // Case-sensitive
  CurrentCultureIgnoreCase,
  InvariantCulture,             // Case-sensitive
  InvariantCultureIgnoreCase,
  Ordinal,                      // Case-sensitive
  OrdinalIgnoreCase
}
```

```c#
Console.WriteLine (string.Equals ("foo", "FOO",
                   StringComparison.OrdinalIgnoreCase));   // True

Console.WriteLine ("ṻ" == "ǖ");                            // False

Console.WriteLine (string.Equals ("ṻ", "ǖ",
                   StringComparison.CurrentCulture));      // ?
```
# what's different between StringComparison Ordinal and InvariantCulture?
`StringComparison.Ordinal` is a binary comparison that compares the Unicode value of each character in a string. It does not take into account culture-specific rules for comparison, and it is case-sensitive. This means that "A" and "a" are considered different characters, and "ä" and "a" are also considered different. This comparison is generally faster than using culture-specific comparisons because it avoids any locale-specific rules.

On the other hand, `StringComparison.InvariantCulture` is a culture-sensitive comparison that compares strings using culture-specific rules. It is case-insensitive, and it takes into account culture-specific rules for comparison, such as sorting rules and character equivalence. This comparison is useful when comparing strings that may come from different cultures, as it ensures consistent results across different locales.

In general,` StringComparison.Ordinal` is more suitable for string comparisons when culture is not relevant, such as file paths, HTTP header values, or GUIDs. On the other hand, StringComparison.InvariantCulture is more appropriate for string comparisons that involve culture-specific data, such as sorting and searching text in user interfaces, or comparing data from different sources that use different cultures.

# String order comparison
String’s CompareTo instance method performs culture-sensitive, case-sensitive order comparison. Unlike the == operator, CompareTo does not use ordinal comparison: for ordering, a culture-sensitive algorithm is much more useful. Here’s the method’s definition:

public int CompareTo (string strB);
or other kinds of comparison, you can call the static Compare and CompareOrdinal methods:

public static int Compare (string strA, string strB,
                           StringComparison comparisonType);

public static int Compare (string strA, string strB, bool ignoreCase,
                           CultureInfo culture);

public static int Compare (string strA, string strB, bool ignoreCase);

public static int CompareOrdinal (string strA, string strB);
The last two methods are simply shortcuts for calling the first two methods.

All of the order comparison methods return a positive number, a negative number, or zero depending on whether the first value comes after, before, or alongside the second value:

Console.WriteLine ("Boston".CompareTo ("Austin"));    // 1
Console.WriteLine ("Boston".CompareTo ("Boston"));    // 0
Console.WriteLine ("Boston".CompareTo ("Chicago"));   // -1
Console.WriteLine ("ṻ".CompareTo ("ǖ"));              // 0
Console.WriteLine ("foo".CompareTo ("FOO"));          // -1

# StringBuilder
The StringBuilder class (System.Text namespace) represents a mutable (editable) string. With a StringBuilder, you can Append, Insert, Remove, and Replace substrings without replacing the whole StringBuilder.

StringBuilder’s constructor optionally accepts an initial string value as well as a starting size for its internal capacity (default is 16 characters). If you go beyond this, StringBuilder automatically resizes its internal structures to accommodate (at a slight performance cost) up to its maximum capacity (default is int.MaxValue).

A popular use of StringBuilder is to build up a long string by repeatedly calling Append. This approach is much more efficient than repeatedly concatenating ordinary string types:

StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
for (int i = 0; i < 50; i++) sb.Append(i).Append(",");
To get the final result, call ToString():

Console.WriteLine (sb.ToString());

0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20,21,22,23,24,25,26,
27,28,29,30,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,40,41,42,43,44,45,46,47,48,49,
AppendLine performs an Append that adds a new line sequence ("\r\n" in Windows). AppendFormat accepts a composite format string, just like String.Format.

In addition to the Insert, Remove, and Replace methods (Replace works like string’s Replace), StringBuilder defines a Length property and a writable indexer for getting/setting individual characters.

`To clear the contents of a StringBuilder, either instantiate a new one or set its Length to zero`

`Note`: Setting a StringBuilder’s Length to zero doesn’t shrink its internal capacity. So, if the StringBuilder previously contained one million characters, it will continue to occupy around two megabytes of memory after zeroing its Length. If you want to release the memory, you must create a new StringBuilder and allow the old one to drop out of scope (and be garbage collected).

# Text Encodings and Unicode
A character set is an allocation of characters, each with a numeric code, or code point. There are two character sets in common use: Unicode and ASCII. Unicode has an address space of approximately one million characters, of which about 100,000 are currently allocated. Unicode covers most spoken world languages as well as some historical languages and special symbols. The ASCII set is simply the first 128 characters of the Unicode set, which covers most of what you see on a US-style keyboard. ASCII predates Unicode by 30 years and is still sometimes used for its simplicity and efficiency: each character is represented by one byte.

The .NET type system is designed tA text encoding maps characters from their numeric code point to a binary representation. In .NET, text encodings come into play primarily when dealing with text files or streams. When you read a text file into a string, a text encoder translates the file data from binary into the internal Unicode representation that the char and string types expect. A text encoding can restrict what characters can be represented as well as affect storage efficiency.

There are two categories of text encoding in .NET:

  - Those that map Unicode characters to another character set
  - Those that use standard Unicode encoding schemeso work with the Unicode character set. ASCII is implicitly supported, though, by virtue of being a subset of Unicode.

The first category contains legacy encodings such as IBM’s EBCDIC and 8-bit character sets with extended characters in the upper-128 region that were popular prior to Unicode (identified by a code page). The ASCII encoding is also in this category: it encodes the first 128 characters and drops everything else. This category contains the nonlegacy GB18030 as well, which is the mandatory standard for applications written in China—or sold to China—since 2000.

In the second category are UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 (and the obsolete UTF-7). Each differs in space efficiency. `UTF-8` is the most space-efficient for most kinds of text: it uses between one and four bytes to represent each character. The first 128 characters require only a single byte, making it compatible with ASCII. `UTF-8 is the most popular encoding for text files and streams (particularly on the internet), and it is the default for stream input/output (I/O) in .NET (in fact, it’s the default for almost everything that implicitly uses an encoding).`

`UTF-16` uses one or two 16-bit words to represent each character. This is what `.NET uses internally to represent characters and strings. Some programs also write files in UTF-16.`  UTF-16 is used by Windows operating systems and some programming languages. It's a good choice when dealing with Asian languages, as most of their characters require 2 bytes to represent.

`UTF-32` is the least space-efficient: it maps each code point directly to 32 bits, so every character consumes four bytes. UTF-32 is rarely used for this reason. It does, however, make random access very easy because every character takes an equal number of bytes.t's a good choice for applications that require high-performance string manipulation, as it allows for constant-time indexing and substring operations.

`Unicode`: Unicode is a character set that assigns a unique number to every character in most of the world's writing systems. It's a good choice for applications that require multilingual support, as it supports characters from almost every writing system in use today.


## Obtaining an Encoding object
The Encoding class in System.Text is the common base type for classes that encapsulate text encodings. There are several subclasses—their purpose is to encapsulate families of encodings with similar features. The most common encodings can be obtained through dedicated static properties on Encoding:

Encoding name	Static property on Encoding
UTF-8	Encoding.UTF8
UTF-16	Encoding.Unicode (not UTF16)
UTF-32	Encoding.UTF32
ASCII	Encoding.ASCII
You can obtain other encodings by calling Encoding.GetEncoding with a standard Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA) Character Set name:

// In .NET 5+ and .NET Core, you must first call RegisterProvider:
Encoding.RegisterProvider (CodePagesEncodingProvider.Instance);

Encoding chinese = Encoding.GetEncoding ("GB18030");
The static GetEncodings method returns a list of all supported encodings along with their standard IANA names:

foreach (EncodingInfo info in Encoding.GetEncodings())
  Console.WriteLine (info.Name);
The other way to obtain an encoding is to directly instantiate an encoding class. Doing so allows you to set various options via constructor arguments, including:

Whether to throw an exception if an invalid byte sequence is encountered when decoding. The default is false.

Whether to encode/decode UTF-16/UTF-32 with the most significant bytes first (big endian) or the least significant bytes first (little endian). The default is little endian, the standard on the Windows operating system.

Whether to emit a byte-order mark (a prefix that indicates endianness).

## Encoding for file and stream I/O
The most common application for an Encoding object is to control how text is read and written to a file or stream. For example, the following writes “Testing…” to a file called data.txt in UTF-16 encoding:

System.IO.File.WriteAllText ("data.txt", "Testing...", Encoding.Unicode);
If you omit the final argument, WriteAllText applies the ubiquitous UTF-8 encoding.

NOTE
`UTF-8 is the default text encoding for all file and stream I/O.`

## Encoding to byte arrays
You can also use an Encoding object to go to and from a byte array. The GetBytes method converts from string to byte[] with the given encoding; GetString converts from byte[] to string:

byte[] utf8Bytes  = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes    ("0123456789");
byte[] utf16Bytes = System.Text.Encoding.Unicode.GetBytes ("0123456789");
byte[] utf32Bytes = System.Text.Encoding.UTF32.GetBytes   ("0123456789");

Console.WriteLine (utf8Bytes.Length);    // 10
Console.WriteLine (utf16Bytes.Length);   // 20
Console.WriteLine (utf32Bytes.Length);   // 40

string original1 = System.Text.Encoding.UTF8.GetString    (utf8Bytes);
string original2 = System.Text.Encoding.Unicode.GetString (utf16Bytes);
string original3 = System.Text.Encoding.UTF32.GetString   (utf32Bytes);

Console.WriteLine (original1);          // 0123456789
Console.WriteLine (original2);          // 0123456789
Console.WriteLine (original3);          // 0123456789

## UTF-16 and surrogate pairs
Recall that .NET stores characters and strings in UTF-16. Because UTF-16 requires one or two 16-bit words per character, and a char is only 16 bits in length, some Unicode characters require two chars to represent. This has a couple of consequences:

A string’s Length property can be greater than its real character count.

A single char is not always enough to fully represent a Unicode character.

Most applications ignore this because nearly all commonly used characters fit into a section of Unicode called the Basic Multilingual Plane (BMP), which requires only one 16-bit word in UTF-16. The BMP covers several dozen world languages and includes more than 30,000 Chinese characters. Excluded are characters of some ancient languages, symbols for musical notation, and some less-common Chinese characters.

If you need to support two-word characters, the following static methods in char convert a 32-bit code point to a string of two chars and back again:

string ConvertFromUtf32 (int utf32)
int    ConvertToUtf32   (char highSurrogate, char lowSurrogate)

`Two-word characters are called surrogates`. They are easy to spot because each word is in the range 0xD800 to 0xDFFF. You can use the following static methods in char to assist:

bool IsSurrogate     (char c)
bool IsHighSurrogate (char c)
bool IsLowSurrogate  (char c)
bool IsSurrogatePair (char highSurrogate, char lowSurrogate)

`One example of a two-word character` is the smiley face emoji 😊, which has a Unicode code point of U+1F60A. This code point falls outside of the BMP and is represented using two surrogates:` 0xD83D and 0xDE0A`. The first surrogate, 0xD83D, is the high surrogate, and the second surrogate, 0xDE0A, is the low surrogate. Together, they form the Unicode code point for the smiley face emoji: 0x1F60A.

The StringInfo class in the System.Globalization namespace also provides a range of methods and properties for working with two-word characters.

Characters outside the BMP typically require special fonts and have limited operating system support.
