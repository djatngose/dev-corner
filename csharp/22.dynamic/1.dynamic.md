# ExpandoObject
Another simple application of DynamicObject would be to write a dynamic class that stored and retrieved objects in a dictionary, keyed by string. However, this functionality is already provided via the ExpandoObject class:

 dynamic x = new ExpandoObject();
    x.FavoriteColor = ConsoleColor.Green;
    x.FavoriteNumber = 7;
    Console.WriteLine (x.FavoriteColor);    // Green
    Console.WriteLine (x.FavoriteNumber);   // 7
ExpandoObject implements IDictionary<string,object>—so we can continue our example and do this:
var dict = (IDictionary<string,object>) x;
Console.WriteLine (dict ["FavoriteColor"]);
Console.WriteLine (dict ["FavoriteNumber"]);
Console.WriteLine (dict.Count);
// Green
// 7
// 2

# Interoperating with Dynamic Languages
Although C# supports dynamic binding via the dynamic keyword, it doesn’t go as far as allowing you to execute an expression described in a string at runtime:
    string expr = "2 * 3";
    // We can’t "execute" expr
This is because the code to translate a string into an expression tree requires a lexical and semantic parser. These features are built into the C# compiler and are not available as a runtime service. At runtime, C# merely provides a binder, which instructs the DLR how to interpret an already-built expression tree.
True dynamic languages such as IronPython and IronRuby do allow you to execute an arbitrary string, and this is useful in tasks such as scripting, dynamic configura‐ tion, and implementing dynamic rules engines. So, although you can write most of your application in C#, it can be useful to call out to a dynamic language for such tasks. In addition, you might want to use an API that is written in a dynamic language where no equivalent functionality is available in a .NET library.

 int result = (int) Calculate ("2 * 3");
    Console.WriteLine (result);              // 6
    object Calculate (string expression)
    {
ScriptEngine engine = Python.CreateEngine();
      return engine.Execute (expression);
}
Because we’re passing a string into Python, the expression will be evaluated accord‐ ing to Python’s rules and not C#’s. It also means that we can use Python’s language features, such as lists:
var list = (IEnumerable) Calculate ("[1, 2, 3] + [4, 5]"); foreach (int n in list) Console.Write (n); // 12345

# Passing State Between C# and a Script
To pass variables from C# to Python, a few more steps are required. The following example illustrates those steps and could be the basis of a rules engine:
// The following string could come from a file or database: string auditRule = "taxPaidLastYear / taxPaidThisYear > 2";
    ScriptEngine engine = Python.CreateEngine ();
    ScriptScope scope = engine.CreateScope ();
scope.SetVariable ("taxPaidLastYear", 20000m); scope.SetVariable ("taxPaidThisYear", 8000m);
    ScriptSource source = engine.CreateScriptSourceFromString (
                          auditRule, SourceCodeKind.Expression);
    bool auditRequired = (bool) source.Execute (scope);
    Console.WriteLine (auditRequired);   // True

You can also get variables back by calling GetVariable: string code = "result = input * 3";
    ScriptEngine engine = Python.CreateEngine();
    ScriptScope scope = engine.CreateScope();
    scope.SetVariable ("input", 2);
ScriptSource source = engine.CreateScriptSourceFromString (code, SourceCodeKind.SingleStatement);
    source.Execute (scope);
    Console.WriteLine (scope.GetVariable ("result"));   // 6
Notice that we specified SourceCodeKind.SingleStatement in the second example (rather than Expression) to inform the engine that we want to execute a statement.
