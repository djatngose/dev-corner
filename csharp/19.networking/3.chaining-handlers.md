# Chaining handlers with DelegatingHandler
You can create a message handler that calls another (resulting in a chain of han‐ dlers) by subclassing DelegatingHandler. You can use this to implement custom authentication, compression, and encryption protocols. The following demonstrates a simple logging handler:
```c#
    class LoggingHandler : DelegatingHandler
    {
      public LoggingHandler (HttpMessageHandler nextHandler)
      {
         InnerHandler = nextHandler;
      }
      protected async override Task <HttpResponseMessage> SendAsync
        (HttpRequestMessage request, CancellationToken cancellationToken)
      {
        Console.WriteLine ("Requesting: " + request.RequestUri);
        var response = await base.SendAsync (request, cancellationToken);
        Console.WriteLine ("Got response: " + response.StatusCode);
        return response;
} }
```
Notice that we’ve maintained asynchrony in overriding SendAsync. Introducing the async modifier when overriding a task-returning method is perfectly legal—and desirable in this case.
A better solution than writing to the Console would be to have the constructor accept some kind of logging object. Better still would be to accept a couple of Action<T> delegates that tell it how to log the request and response objects.
