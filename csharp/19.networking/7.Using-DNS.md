# DNS

The static Dns class encapsulates the DNS, `which converts between a raw IP address, such as 66.135.192.87, and a human-friendly domain name, such as ebay.com.`
The GetHostAddresses method converts from domain name to IP address (or addresses):
```c#
   foreach (IPAddress a in Dns.GetHostAddresses ("albahari.com"))
      Console.WriteLine (a.ToString());     // 205.210.42.167

```

The GetHostEntry method goes the other way around, converting from address to domain name:
```c#
    IPHostEntry entry = Dns.GetHostEntry ("205.210.42.167");
    Console.WriteLine (entry.HostName);                    // albahari.com
    ```
GetHostEntry also accepts an IPAddress object, so you can specify an IP address as a byte array:
    IPAddress address = new IPAddress (new byte[] { 205, 210, 42, 167 });
    IPHostEntry entry = Dns.GetHostEntry (address);
    Console.WriteLine (entry.HostName);                    // albahari.com
Domain names are automatically resolved to IP addresses when you use a class suc


Domain names are automatically resolved to IP addresses when you use a class such as WebRequest or TcpClient. However, if you plan to make many network requests to the same address over the life of an application, you can sometimes improve performance by first using Dns to explicitly convert the domain name into an IP address, and then communicating directly with the IP address from that point on. This avoids repeated round-tripping to resolve the same domain name, and it can be of benefit when dealing at the transport layer (via TcpClient, UdpClient, or Socket).
The DNS class also provides awaitable task-based asynchronous methods:
foreach (IPAddress a in await Dns.GetHostAddressesAsync ("albahari.com")) Console.WriteLine (a.ToString());
