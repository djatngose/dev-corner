# Encrypting in Memory
From .NET 6, you can utilize the EncryptCbc and DecryptCbc methods to shortcut the process of encrypting and decrypting byte arrays:
```c#
    public static byte[] Encrypt (byte[] data, byte[] key, byte[] iv)
    {
      using Aes algorithm = Aes.Create();
          algorithm.Key = key;
      return algorithm.EncryptCbc (data, iv);
    }
    public static byte[] Decrypt (byte[] data, byte[] key, byte[] iv)
    {
      using Aes algorithm = Aes.Create();
      algorithm.Key = key;
      return algorithm.DecryptCbc (data, iv);
}
```

Here’s an equivalent that works in all.NET versions:
```c#
    public static byte[] Encrypt (byte[] data, byte[] key, byte[] iv)
    {
      using (Aes algorithm = Aes.Create())
      using (ICryptoTransform encryptor = algorithm.CreateEncryptor (key, iv))
        return Crypt (data, encryptor);
    }
    public static byte[] Decrypt (byte[] data, byte[] key, byte[] iv)
    {
      using (Aes algorithm = Aes.Create())
      using (ICryptoTransform decryptor = algorithm.CreateDecryptor (key, iv))
        return Crypt (data, decryptor);
    }
    static byte[] Crypt (byte[] data, ICryptoTransform cryptor)
    {
      MemoryStream m = new MemoryStream();
      using (Stream c = new CryptoStream (m, cryptor, CryptoStreamMode.Write))
        c.Write (data, 0, data.Length);
      return m.ToArray();
}
```
# Chaining Encryption Streams
CryptoStream is a decorator, meaning that you can chain it with other streams. In the following example, we write compressed encrypted text to a file and then read it back:
    byte[] key = new byte [16];
    byte[] iv = new byte [16];
    var cryptoRng = RandomNumberGenerator.Create();
    cryptoRng.GetBytes (key);
    cryptoRng.GetBytes (iv);
using (Aes algorithm = Aes.Create()) {
      using (ICryptoTransform encryptor = algorithm.CreateEncryptor(key, iv))
      using (Stream f = File.Create ("serious.bin"))
      using (Stream c = new CryptoStream (f, encryptor, CryptoStreamMode.Write))
      using (Stream d = new DeflateStream (c, CompressionMode.Compress))
      using (StreamWriter w = new StreamWriter (d))
        await w.WriteLineAsync ("Small and secure!");
      using (ICryptoTransform decryptor = algorithm.CreateDecryptor(key, iv))
      using (Stream f = File.OpenRead ("serious.bin"))
      using (Stream c = new CryptoStream (f, decryptor, CryptoStreamMode.Read))
      using (Stream d = new DeflateStream (c, CompressionMode.Decompress))
      using (StreamReader r = new StreamReader (d))
        Console.WriteLine (await r.ReadLineAsync());     // Small and secure!
    }
(As a final touch, we make our program asynchronous by calling WriteLineAsync and ReadLineAsync and awaiting the result.)
In this example, all one-letter variables form part of a chain. The mathematicians— algorithm, encryptor, and decryptor—are there to assist CryptoStream in the cipher work, as illustrated in Figure 20-1.
Chaining streams in this manner demands little memory, regardless of the ultimate stream sizes.
