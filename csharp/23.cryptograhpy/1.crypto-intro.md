# Encryption and hashing options in .NET
- `File.Encrypt`
  - Key to manage: 0
  - Speed: Fast
  - Strength: Depends on user’s password
  - Protects files transparently with filesystem support. A key is derived implicitly from the logged-in user’s credentials. Windows only.

- `Windows Data Protection`
  - Key to manage: 0
  - Speed: Fast
  - Strength: Depends on user’s password
  - Encrypts and decrypts byte arrays using an implicitly derived key.

- `Hashing`
  - Key to manage: 0
  - Speed: Fast
  - Strength: High
  - One-way (irreversible) transformation. Used for storing passwords, comparing files, and checking for data corruption.

- `Symmetric Encryption`
  - Key to manage: 1
  - Speed: Fast
  - Strength: High
  - For general-purpose encryption/decryption. The same key encrypts and decrypts. Can be used to secure messages in transit.

- `Public Key Encryption`
  - Key to manage: 2
  - Speed: Slow
  - Strength: High
  - Encryption and decryption use different keys. Used for exchanging a symmetric key in message transmission and for digitally signing files



# Use cases
`File.Encrypt:`

Use Case: Encrypting sensitive files on a Windows machine.
Example: A user wants to protect confidential documents stored on their computer. They use File.Encrypt to encrypt the files, which adds an additional layer of security. Only the user with the appropriate credentials can decrypt and access the files.

`Windows Data Protection:`

Use Case: Encrypting and decrypting sensitive data within a .NET application.
Example: An application needs to store sensitive user data, such as passwords or credit card information. The application uses Windows Data Protection to encrypt the data before storing it in a database or file. The data can be decrypted when needed using the same user's credentials.

`Hashing:`

Use Case: Storing and verifying user passwords securely.
Example: A website's user authentication system hashes user passwords before storing them in a database. When a user logs in, their entered password is hashed and compared against the stored hash. If the hashes match, the user is granted access.

`Symmetric Encryption:`

Use Case: Securing sensitive data during transmission.
Example: A messaging application wants to ensure that messages sent between users are securely encrypted. It uses symmetric encryption with a shared key to encrypt the messages before transmission. `The same key is used by the recipient to decrypt and read the messages.`

`Public Key Encryption:`


Use Case: Secure communication and digital signatures.
Example: A secure messaging platform wants to allow users to exchange messages securely and verify the authenticity of received messages. `Public key encryption is used to establish secure communication channels and digitally sign messages to ensure their integrity and origin.`

# what different Public Key Encryption and Synmetric Encrypt?
## Key Management:

`Public Key Encryption`: It uses two different keys: a public key for encryption and a private key for decryption. The public key can be freely distributed, while the private key must be kept secret. Anyone can use the recipient's public key to encrypt a message, but only the recipient possessing the corresponding private key can decrypt it.

`Symmetric Encryption`: It uses a single shared key for both encryption and decryption. This means the same key is used by both the sender and recipient. The key needs to be securely shared or exchanged between the communicating parties.
## Speed:

`Public Key Encryption`: It involves complex mathematical operations, making it computationally intensive. Public key encryption algorithms are generally slower compared to symmetric encryption algorithms.

`Symmetric Encryption`: It uses simpler mathematical operations, which makes it faster and more efficient for encrypting and decrypting large amounts of data.
## Use Cases:

`Public Key Encryption`: It is primarily used for secure key exchange, establishing secure communication channels, and digital signatures. It is suitable for scenarios where two parties need to securely communicate and exchange information without previously sharing a secret key.

`Symmetric Encryption`: It is commonly used for general-purpose encryption and decryption. It is efficient for securing data during transmission, storage, or within closed systems where the communicating parties already share a secret key.

# What if I want  to encrypt a password securely and also descrypt it to cleartext, Which one I choose Public key or Symmetric key encryption?
If you want to encrypt a password securely and also be able to decrypt it back to plaintext, the more appropriate choice would be `symmetric key encryption`.

Here's why:

`Securely Encrypting the Password:`
Symmetric encryption can securely encrypt the password using a shared key. You can generate a strong symmetric key and use it to encrypt the password before storing it or transmitting it. The same key is then used to decrypt the password when needed.

`Decrypting the Password to Plaintext:`
Since you want to be able to decrypt the password back to plaintext, symmetric encryption allows for straightforward decryption. As long as you have the correct key, you can easily decrypt the encrypted password and retrieve the original plaintext value.

`Efficiency and Performance:`
Symmetric encryption is faster and more efficient compared to public key encryption. Since you are encrypting and decrypting a password, which is typically a small amount of data, the computational overhead of symmetric encryption is negligible.

On the other hand, public key encryption is not commonly used for directly encrypting and decrypting passwords. Public key encryption is more suitable for secure key exchange and establishing trust between parties. If you use public key encryption, you would encrypt the password with the recipient's public key, and only the recipient with the corresponding private key could decrypt it. However, this would not allow you to decrypt the password back to plaintext since you would not possess the private key.

In summary, if you need to securely encrypt a password and also be able to decrypt it back to plaintext, symmetric key encryption is the preferred choice due to its efficiency, straightforward decryption process, and suitability for this specific use case.
