# Digital Signing
You also can use public key algorithms to digitally sign messages or documents.
`A signature is like a hash, except that its production requires a private key and so cannot be forged. The public key is used to verify the signature`. Here’s an example:
```c#
byte[] data = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes ("Message to sign");
    byte[] publicKey;
    byte[] signature;
    object hasher = SHA1.Create();         // Our chosen hashing algorithm.
    // Generate a new key pair, then sign the data with it:
    using (var publicPrivate = new RSACryptoServiceProvider())
    {
      signature = publicPrivate.SignData (data, hasher);
      publicKey = publicPrivate.ExportCspBlob (false);    // get public key
    }
    // Create a fresh RSA using just the public key, then test the signature.
    using (var publicOnly = new RSACryptoServiceProvider())
    {
      publicOnly.ImportCspBlob (publicKey);
      Console.Write (publicOnly.VerifyData (data, hasher, signature)); // True
      // Let's now tamper with the data and recheck the signature:
      data[0] = 0;
      Console.Write (publicOnly.VerifyData (data, hasher, signature)); // False
      // The following throws an exception as we're lacking a private key:
      signature = publicOnly.SignData (data, hasher);
    }
```

Signing works by first hashing the data and then applying the asymmetric algorithm to the resultant hash. Because hashes are of a small fixed size, large documents can be signed relatively quickly (public key encryption is much more CPU-intensive than hashing). If you want, you can do the hashing yourself and then call SignHash instead of SignData:
```c#
    using (var rsa = new RSACryptoServiceProvider())
    {
byte[] hash = SHA1.Create().ComputeHash (data);
signature = rsa.SignHash (hash, CryptoConfig.MapNameToOID ("SHA1")); ...
}
```
`SignHash` still needs to know what hash algorithm you used; CryptoConfig.Map NameToOID provides this information in the correct format from a friendly name such as “SHA1”.
RSACryptoServiceProvider produces signatures whose size matches that of the key. Currently, no mainstream algorithm produces secure signatures significantly smaller than 128 bytes (suitable for product activation codes, for instance).

`Note`: For signing to be effective, the recipient must know, and trust, the sender’s public key. This can happen via prior com‐ munication, preconfiguration, or a site certificate. A site cer‐ tificate is an electronic record of the originator’s public key and name—itself signed by an independent trusted authority. The namespace System.Security.Cryptography.X509Certif icates defines the types for working with certificates.

# What if I want to input a privatekey not auto generated?
If you want to use a pre-existing private key instead of generating a new one, you can do so by importing the private key into the RSACryptoServiceProvider instance. Here's an example of how you can import a private key:

```c#
string privateKey = "<your private key in PEM or PKCS#8 format>";

using (var rsa = new RSACryptoServiceProvider())
{
    rsa.ImportPrivateKey(privateKey);

    // Use the RSA instance for signing or other cryptographic operations
    // ...
}
```
In this example, the privateKey variable should contain the private key in either PEM (Privacy-Enhanced Mail) or PKCS#8 (Public-Key Cryptography Standards #8) format. The ImportPrivateKey method is a custom extension method that you would need to implement to handle the import logic.

The exact implementation of the ImportPrivateKey method will depend on the format of the private key you are working with. You may need to parse the key, convert it to a specific format, and then import it into the RSACryptoServiceProvider. Libraries like BouncyCastle or OpenSSL.NET can be helpful for working with different key formats.

It's important to note that handling private keys requires caution and proper security practices. Make sure to protect the private key and keep it confidential.
