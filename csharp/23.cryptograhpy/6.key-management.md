# Key Management
`Key management` is a critical element of security: if your keys are exposed, so is your data. You need to consider who should have access to keys and how to back them up in case of hardware failure while storing them in a manner that prevents unauthorized access.
`It is inadvisable to hardcode encryption keys because popular tools exist to decompile assemblies with little expertise required. A better option (on Windows) is to manufacture a random key for each installation, storing it securely with Windows Data Protection.`
For applications deployed to the `cloud, Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS) offer key-management systems with additional features that can be useful in an enterprise environment, such as audit trails.`
If youâ€™re encrypting a message stream, public-key encryption still provides the best option.

# Can i store keys in web.config in .net?

Storing encryption keys directly in the web.config file is generally not considered a secure approach. The web.config file is a configuration file for ASP.NET applications that can be accessed by administrators, developers, and potentially other users with the necessary access rights. Storing sensitive information like encryption keys in plain text within the web.config file exposes them to potential unauthorized access.

If an attacker gains access to your server or the web.config file, they could easily retrieve the keys. Additionally, as you mentioned, assemblies can be decompiled, which could potentially expose the keys if they are stored directly in the code or configuration files.

To improve the security of your encryption keys, it is recommended to follow established key management best practices:

`Use a Key Management System (KMS)`: Consider using a dedicated key management system that provides secure storage and management of encryption keys. Cloud providers like Microsoft Azure Key Vault or AWS Key Management Service (KMS) offer robust key management solutions with additional security features and audit trails.

`Protect Keys with Windows Data Protection (DPAPI)`: On Windows platforms, you can leverage the Windows Data Protection API (DPAPI) to encrypt and securely store sensitive data, including encryption keys. DPAPI provides data protection based on the user or machine context, making it more secure than storing keys in plain text.

`Separate Key Storage`: Store the encryption keys in a separate, secure location, `such as a protected database, secure file system, or hardware security module (HSM)`. This approach ensures that even if an attacker gains access to the application or server, they won't have direct access to the keys.

`Key Rotation`: Implement a key rotation policy to regularly change encryption keys. This practice helps limit the potential impact of key compromise and improves overall security.

Remember, the security of your encryption keys is crucial to maintaining the confidentiality and integrity of your data. Assess your specific security requirements and consult with a security professional or architect to determine the most appropriate key management strategy for your application.
