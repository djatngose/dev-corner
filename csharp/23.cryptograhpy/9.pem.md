The PEM format solves this problem by encoding the binary data using base64. PEM also defines a one-line header, consisting of -----BEGIN, a label, and -----, and a one-line footer, consisting of -----END, a label, and -----. The label determines the type of message encoded. Common labels include CERTIFICATE, CERTIFICATE REQUEST, PRIVATE KEY and X509 CRL.

-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----

-----END PRIVATE KEY-----
