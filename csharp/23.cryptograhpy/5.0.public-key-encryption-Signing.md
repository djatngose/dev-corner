# Public-Key Encryption and Signing
`Public-key cryptography` is `asymmetric`, meaning that encryption and decryption use different keys.
Unlike symmetric encryption, for which any arbitrary series of bytes of appropriate length can serve as a key, asymmetric cryptography requires specially crafted key pairs. A key pair contains a public key and private key component that work together as follows:
• The public key encrypts messages.
• The private key decrypts messages.

The party “crafting” a key pair keeps the private key secret while distributing the public key freely. A special feature of this type of cryptography is that `you cannot calculate a private key from a public key`. So, `if the private key is lost, encrypted data cannot be recovered; conversely, if a private key is leaked, the encryption system becomes useless.`

A public key handshake allows two computers to communicate securely over a public network, with no prior contact and no existing shared secret. To see how this works, suppose that computer Origin wants to send a confidential message to computer Target:
1. Target generates a public/private key pair and then sends its public key to Origin.
2. Origin encrypts the confidential message using Target’s public key and then sends it to Target.
3. Target decrypts the confidential message using its private key.

An eavesdropper will see the following:
• Target’s public key
• The secret message, encrypted with Target’s public key

But without Target’s private key, the message cannot be decrypted.
This doesn’t prevent against a man-in-the-middle attack: in other words, Origin cannot know that Target isn’t some mali‐ cious party. To authenticate the recipient, the originator needs to already know the recipient’s public key or be able to validate its key through a digital site certificate.

Because public key encryption is relatively slow and its message size limited, the secret message sent from Origin to Target typically contains a fresh key for subse‐ quent symmetric encryption. This allows public key encryption to be abandoned for the remainder of the session, in favor of a symmetric algorithm capable of handling larger messages. This protocol is particularly secure if a fresh public/private key pair is generated for each session because no keys then need to be stored on either computer.

# Types

In .NET, there are several types of public key encryption algorithms available for asymmetric encryption. The supported algorithms may vary depending on the version of .NET and the cryptographic libraries being used. Here are some commonly used public key encryption algorithms in .NET:

## `RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman)`: 
RSA is one of the most widely used public key encryption algorithms. It supports both encryption and digital signatures and is available in .NET through the RSACryptoServiceProvider and RSA classes.
`Security Strength:` RSA with a sufficient key size (e.g., 2048 bits or higher) is considered secure against current cryptographic attacks. However, larger key sizes are recommended for long-term security.
`Key Size`: RSA key sizes need to be larger compared to elliptic curve cryptography (ECC) to achieve similar security levels. For example, a 2048-bit RSA key is roughly equivalent in strength to a 224-bit ECC key.
`Compatibility`: RSA is widely supported and used in various protocols and systems.
Performance: RSA encryption and decryption operations are generally slower compared to ECC algorithms, especially for larger key sizes.
`Signature Generation and Verification:` RSA signature generation and verification operations are computationally more expensive than ECDSA.

## `ECDH (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman)`
ECDH is an asymmetric key agreement algorithm based on elliptic curve cryptography. It is used for secure key exchange between parties. In .NET, ECDH is available through the ECDiffieHellman class.



## `ECDHE (Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman Ephemeral`): ECDHE is an extension of ECDH that provides forward secrecy. It generates a new key pair for each session, ensuring that even if one session's private key is compromised, the others remain secure. ECDHE is also available in .NET through the ECDiffieHellman class.

## `DSA (Digital Signature Algorithm)`: DSA is a public key algorithm primarily used for digital signatures. It is available in .NET through the DSACryptoServiceProvider and DSA classes.

## `ECDSA (Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm):` ECDSA is a variant of DSA based on elliptic curve cryptography. It provides stronger security with shorter key lengths compared to traditional DSA. ECDSA is supported in .NET through the ECDsa class.


`Security Strength`: ECDSA provides strong security with shorter key lengths compared to RSA. Elliptic curve cryptography leverages the mathematical properties of elliptic curves to achieve the same security level with smaller key sizes.
`Key Size`: ECDSA key sizes are shorter compared to RSA for achieving similar security levels. For example, a 256-bit ECDSA key is roughly equivalent in strength to a 3072-bit RSA key.
`Compatibility`: ECDSA may have slightly less widespread support in older systems and protocols compared to RSA. However, it is increasingly becoming more widely adopted.
`Performance`: ECDSA operations, such as signature generation, verification, encryption, and decryption, are generally faster compared to RSA for similar security levels.


It's important to note that both RSA and ECDSA are widely used and have been extensively studied and analyzed by cryptographic experts. The choice between them should be based on your specific requirements, including compatibility needs, performance considerations, and any existing infrastructure or standards you need to adhere to.

In general, if you're looking for a widely supported and versatile option with larger key sizes, RSA is a good choice. If you prioritize performance and shorter key sizes while maintaining strong security, ECDSA is a viable alternative. Ultimately, it is recommended to consult with cryptographic experts and consider your specific use case and requirements to determine the best asymmetric encryption algorithm for your needs.
