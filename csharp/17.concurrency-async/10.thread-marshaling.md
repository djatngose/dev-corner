# Thread marshaling
Thread marshaling is the process of transferring data between threads in a multithreaded application. In a multithreaded application, different threads can run concurrently, accessing shared data and resources. However, accessing shared data from multiple threads can result in synchronization issues, race conditions, and other problems that can lead to bugs and crashes.

To avoid these problems, thread marshaling provides a mechanism for threads to safely pass data between each other. The general idea is to `encapsulate the data in a message or an object and then send it from one thread to another using a synchronization mechanism such as a mutex or a semaphore`. The receiving thread can then safely access the data without worrying about synchronization issues.

There are different types of thread marshaling techniques available in different programming languages and platforms, such as .NET Remoting, Windows Communication Foundation (WCF), and .NET Framework's System.Windows.Forms.Control.Invoke method. These techniques provide a convenient way to perform thread-safe operations on user interface controls, which can only be accessed from the thread that created them.
