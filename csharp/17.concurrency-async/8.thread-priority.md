# Thread Priority
A thread’s Priority property determines how much execution time it is allotted relative to other active threads in the OS, on the following scale:
```c#
    enum ThreadPriority { Lowest, BelowNormal, Normal, AboveNormal, Highest }
```
This becomes relevant when multiple threads are simultaneously active.` You need to take care when elevating a thread’s priority because it can starve other threads`
If you want a thread to have higher priority than threads in other processes, you must also elevate the process priority using the Process class in System.Diagnostics:

```c#
 using Process p = Process.GetCurrentProcess();
    p.PriorityClass = ProcessPriorityClass.High;
```

This can work well for non-UI processes that do minimal work and need low latency (the ability to respond very quickly) in the work they do. With compute- hungry applications (particularly those with a user interface), elevating process priority can starve other processes, slowing down the entire computer.

By setting the priority class to "High", the operating system will give more CPU time to the threads in the process, which can improve the responsiveness of the application. However, setting the priority too high can also cause other processes on the system to be starved of CPU time, leading to a decrease in overall system performance. Therefore, it is important to use this feature judiciously and only when necessary.
