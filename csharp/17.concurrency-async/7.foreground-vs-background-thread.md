# Foreground Versus Background Threads
`By default, threads you create explicitly are foreground threads`. `Foreground threads keep the application alive for as long as any one of them is running, whereas background threads do not.` After all foreground threads finish, the application ends, and any background threads still running abruptly terminate.

A thread’s foreground/background status has no relation to its priority (allocation of execution time).

You can query or change a thread’s background status using its IsBackground property:
    static void Main (string[] args)
    {
      Thread worker = new Thread ( () => Console.ReadLine() );
      if (args.Length > 0) worker.IsBackground = true;
      worker.Start();
}
If this program is called with no arguments, the worker thread assumes foreground status and will wait on the ReadLine statement for the user to press Enter. Meanwhile, the main thread exits, but the application keeps running because a foreground thread is still alive. `On the other hand, if an argument is passed to Main(), the worker is assigned background status, and the program exits almost immediately as the main thread ends (terminating the ReadLine).`

When a process terminates abruptly, such as when the user closes the application or the application crashes, any finally blocks in the execution stack of background threads may not be executed. This can lead to cleanup work, such as deleting temporary files, not being performed. To avoid this, you can explicitly wait for background threads to finish before exiting the application. This can be done by joining the thread or using a signaling construct. It's important to specify a timeout in case the thread does not finish, so that the application does not hang indefinitely.

For example, if your application starts a background thread to perform some work, you can wait for the thread to finish before exiting the application:

```c#
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    Thread backgroundThread = new Thread(DoWork);
    backgroundThread.Start();

    // Wait for the background thread to finish
    if (!backgroundThread.Join(TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10)))
    {
        // The thread did not finish within 10 seconds
        // Log an error or display a message to the user
    }

    // Exit the application
    Environment.Exit(0);
}

static void DoWork()
{
    // Perform some work
    // ...

    // Clean up resources
    // ...
}

```
