# Task.Delay
The Delay method that we just wrote is sufficiently useful that itâ€™s available as a static method on the Task class:
Task.Delay (5000).GetAwaiter().OnCompleted (() => Console.WriteLine (42)); or:
Task.Delay (5000).ContinueWith (ant => Console.WriteLine (42)); Task.Delay is the asynchronous equivalent of Thread.Sleep.
