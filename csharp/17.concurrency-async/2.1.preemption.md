# Preemption
`Preemption` is the act of temporarily interrupting a running thread by an external factor such as the operating system scheduler. When a thread is preempted, it means that it is forcibly paused in order to allow another thread to run, either because it has used up its allotted time slice or because a higher-priority thread needs to execute.

In most cases, a thread cannot control when it is preempted or which thread is scheduled to run next. This means that a thread must be designed to handle `preemption` and to save its state so that it can be resumed later without losing its place in its execution. `Preemption` can lead to some challenges in multi-threaded programming, such as race conditions, deadlocks, and priority inversion. Therefore, it is important to carefully design and test multithreaded code to avoid these issues..

To avoid these issues, C# provides several synchronization primitives, such as locks, semaphores, and monitors, that allow threads to coordinate their access to shared resources and avoid interference. Additionally, C# also provides constructs like async/await and Task Parallel Library (TPL) that simplify asynchronous programming and make it easier to write concurrent code that is less prone to preemption-related issues.

```c#
using System;
using System.Threading;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Thread t1 = new Thread(new ThreadStart(Worker1));
        Thread t2 = new Thread(new ThreadStart(Worker2));

        t1.Start();
        t2.Start();

        // Wait for the threads to complete
        t1.Join();
        t2.Join();

        Console.WriteLine("Done");
        Console.ReadLine();
    }

    static void Worker1()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Worker1: {0}", i);
            Thread.Sleep(100); // Simulate some work
        }
    }

    static void Worker2()
    {
        for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Worker2: {0}", i);
            Thread.Sleep(100); // Simulate some work
        }
    }
}

```
In this example, we create two threads, t1 and t2, and start them both simultaneously. Each thread executes a simple loop that prints some output and then sleeps for 100 milliseconds. The idea is to simulate some work being done on each thread.

However, because the threads are executing concurrently and may be preempted by the scheduler at any time, the output may be interleaved in unpredictable ways. For example, the output might look something like this:

```c#
Worker2: 0
Worker1: 0
Worker2: 1
Worker1: 1
Worker1: 2
Worker2: 2
Worker1: 3
Worker2: 3
Worker2: 4
Worker1: 4
Worker2: 5
Worker1: 5
Worker1: 6
Worker2: 6
Worker2: 7
Worker1: 7
Worker2: 8
Worker1: 8
Worker2: 9
Worker1: 9
Done

```
After it’s started, a thread’s IsAlive property returns true, until the point at which the thread ends. A thread ends when the delegate passed to the Thread’s constructor finishes executing. After it’s ended, a thread cannot restart.

The static Thread.CurrentThread property gives you the currently executing thread:
    Console.WriteLine (Thread.CurrentThread.Name);
