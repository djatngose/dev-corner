# TaskCompletionSource
It is a powerful tool for creating custom asynchronous operations that are not covered by the built-in asynchronous APIs in the .NET Framework. 

We’ve seen how T`ask.Run `creates a task that runs a delegate on a pooled (or non-pooled) thread. Another way to create a task is with TaskCompletionSource.

`TaskCompletionSource` lets you create a task out of any operation that completes in the future. It works by giving you a “slave” task that you manually drive—by indicating when the operation finishes or faults. This is ideal for I/O-bound work: you get all the benefits of tasks (with their ability to propagate return values, exceptions, and continuations) without blocking a thread for the duration of the operation.

To use `TaskCompletionSource`, you simply instantiate the class. It exposes a Task property that returns a task upon which you can wait and attach continuations— just as with any other task. The task, however, is controlled entirely by the Task CompletionSource object via the following methods:
```c#
public class TaskCompletionSource<TResult>
    {
      public void SetResult (TResult result);
      public void SetException (Exception exception);
      public void SetCanceled();
      public bool TrySetResult (TResult result);
      public bool TrySetException (Exception exception);
      public bool TrySetCanceled();
      public bool TrySetCanceled (CancellationToken cancellationToken);
      ...
}

```
Calling any of these methods signals the task, putting it into a completed, faulted, or canceled state (we cover the latter in the section “Cancellation” on page 659). You’re supposed to call one of these methods exactly once: if called again, Set Result, SetException, or SetCanceled will throw an exception, whereas the Try* methods return false.

The following example prints 42 after waiting for five seconds:
```c#
    var tcs = new TaskCompletionSource<int>();
    new Thread (() => { Thread.Sleep (5000); tcs.SetResult (42); })
      { IsBackground = true }
      .Start();
    Task<int> task = tcs.Task;         // Our "slave" task.
    Console.WriteLine (task.Result);   // 42
```
With TaskCompletionSource, we can write our own Run method:
```c#
    Task<TResult> Run<TResult> (Func<TResult> function)
    {
      var tcs = new TaskCompletionSource<TResult>();
      new Thread (() =>
      {

try { tcs.SetResult (function()); }
catch (Exception ex) { tcs.SetException (ex); } }).Start();
return tcs.Task;
    }
    ...
    Task<int> task = Run (() => { Thread.Sleep (5000); return 42; });
```

Calling this method is equivalent to calling Task.Factory.StartNew with the Task CreationOptions.LongRunning option to request a nonpooled thread.

The real power of TaskCompletionSource is in creating tasks that don’t tie up threads. For instance, consider a task that waits for five seconds and then returns the number 42. We can write this without a thread by using the Timer class, which, with the help of the CLR (and in turn, the OS), fires an event in x milliseconds 

```c#
 Task<int> GetAnswerToLife()
{
      var tcs = new TaskCompletionSource<int>();
      // Create a timer that fires once in 5000 ms:
      var timer = new System.Timers.Timer (5000) { AutoReset = false }; timer.Elapsed += delegate { timer.Dispose(); tcs.SetResult (42); }; timer.Start();
    return tcs.Task;
}
```


Hence, our method returns a task that completes five seconds later, with a result of 42. By attaching a continuation to the task, we can write its result without blocking any thread:
```c#
    var awaiter = GetAnswerToLife().GetAwaiter();
    awaiter.OnCompleted (() => Console.WriteLine (awaiter.GetResult()));
```
We could make this more useful and turn it into a general-purpose Delay method by parameterizing the delay time and getting rid of the return value. This means having it return a Task instead of a Task<int>. However, there’s no nongeneric version of TaskCompletionSource, which means we can’t directly create a nongene‐ ric Task. The workaround is simple: because Task<TResult> derives from Task, we create a TaskCompletionSource<anything> and then implicitly convert the Task<anything> that it gives you into a Task, like this:
```c#
    var tcs = new TaskCompletionSource<object>();
    Task task = tcs.Task;
```   
Now we can write our general-purpose Delay method:
```c#
Task Delay (int milliseconds)
{
  var tcs = new TaskCompletionSource<object>();
  var timer = new System.Timers.Timer (milliseconds) { AutoReset = false }; timer.Elapsed += delegate { timer.Dispose(); tcs.SetResult (null); }; timer.Start();
  return tcs.Task;
}
```
`NET 5` introduces a nongeneric TaskCompletionSource, so if you’re targeting .NET 5 or above, you can substitute TaskCom pletionSource<object> for TaskCompletionSource.
Here’s how we can use it to write “42” after five seconds:
    Delay (5000).GetAwaiter().OnCompleted (() => Console.WriteLine (42));
Our use of TaskCompletionSource without a thread means that a thread is engaged only when the continuation starts, five seconds later.` We can demonstrate this by starting 10,000 of these operations at once without error or excessive resource consumption:`
```c#
for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++)
      Delay (5000).GetAwaiter().OnCompleted (() => Console.WriteLine (42));
```

Timers fire their callbacks on pooled threads, so after five seconds, the thread pool will receive 10,000 requests to call SetResult(null) on a TaskCompletionSource. If the requests arrive faster than they can be processed, the thread pool will respond by enqueuing and then processing them at the opti‐ mum level of parallelism for the CPU. This is ideal if the thread-bound jobs are short running, which is true in this case: the thread-bound job is merely the call to SetResult plus either the action of posting the continuation to the syn‐ chronization context (in a UI application) or otherwise the continuation itself (Console.WriteLine(42)).


# Wrapping a synchronous operation
Wrapping a synchronous operation: If you have a synchronous operation that you need to expose as an asynchronous operation, you can create a new TaskCompletionSource, call the synchronous operation, and then complete the task with the result or error.
```c#
Task<int> DoSomethingAsync()
{
    var tcs = new TaskCompletionSource<int>();

    try
    {
        int result = DoSomethingSynchronous();
        tcs.SetResult(result);
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        tcs.SetException(ex);
    }

    return tcs.Task;
}

int DoSomethingSynchronous()
{
    Thread.Sleep(1000);
    return 10;
}

var result = await DoSomethingAsync();
Console.WriteLine(result);

```

# Implementing a custom timeout
If you have a `long-running asynchronous operation` that you want to cancel if it takes too long to complete, you can create a TaskCompletionSource and use a System.Threading.Timer to set a timeout. If the timer elapses before the operation completes, you can cancel the task.

```c#
public Task<int> DoSomethingAsync(int timeoutMilliseconds)
{
    var tcs = new TaskCompletionSource<int>();

    var timer = new Timer(_ => tcs.TrySetCanceled(), null, timeoutMilliseconds, Timeout.Infinite);

    DoSomethingAsynchronous(result =>
    {
        tcs.TrySetResult(result);
        timer.Dispose();
    }, error =>
    {
        tcs.TrySetException(error);
        timer.Dispose();
    });

    return tcs.Task;
}

```

# Composing multiple tasks
If you have multiple asynchronous operations that you want to combine into a single task, you can create a TaskCompletionSource and use the Task.WhenAll or Task.WhenAny methods to combine the tasks. Once all of the underlying tasks complete, you can complete the TaskCompletionSource with the combined result.

```c#
public Task<int[]> DoMultipleThingsAsync()
{
    var tcs = new TaskCompletionSource<int[]>();

    var tasks = new[] { DoSomethingAsync(), DoSomethingElseAsync() };

    Task.WhenAll(tasks).ContinueWith(_ =>
    {
        if (tasks.All(t => t.Status == TaskStatus.RanToCompletion))
        {
            var results = tasks.Select(t => t.Result).ToArray();
            tcs.SetResult(results);
        }
        else
        {
            var errors = tasks.Where(t => t.IsFaulted).SelectMany(t => t.Exception.InnerExceptions);
            tcs.SetException(new AggregateException(errors));
        }
    });

    return tcs.Task;
}

```
