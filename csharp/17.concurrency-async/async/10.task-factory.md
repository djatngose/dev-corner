# TaskFactory
When you call `Task.Factory,` you’re calling a static property on Task that returns a `default TaskFactory object`. The purpose of a task factory is to `create tasks`; specifically, three kinds of tasks:
  - `“Ordinary” tasks (via StartNew)`
  - `Continuations with multiple antecedents` (via ContinueWhenAll and ContinueWhenAny)
  - Tasks that wrap methods that follow the defunct APM (via FromAsync; see “Obsolete Patterns” on page 667)

Another way to create tasks is to `instantiate Task and call Start`. However, this lets you create only `“ordinary” tasks`, not continuations.

# Creating your own task factories
`TaskFactory` is `not an abstract factory`: you can actually instantiate the class, and this is useful when you want to repeatedly create tasks using the same (nonstandard) values for `TaskCreationOptions, TaskContinuationOptions, or TaskScheduler`. For example, if we want to repeatedly create long-running parented tasks, we could create a custom factory, as follows:
```c#
var factory = new TaskFactory (
  TaskCreationOptions.LongRunning |
  TaskCreationOptions.AttachedToParent, TaskContinuationOptions.None);
```
Creating tasks is then simply a matter of calling StartNew on the factory:
```c#
Task task1 = factory.StartNew (Method1);
Task task2 = factory.StartNew (Method2);
...
```
