# Creating and Starting Tasks
`Task.Run` creates and starts a` Task or Task<TResult>`. This method is actually a shortcut for calling `Task.Factory.StartNew`, which allows greater flexibility through additional overloads.

## Specifying a state object
`Task.Factory.StartNew` lets you specify a state object that is passed to the target. The target method’s signature must then comprise a single object-type parameter:
```c#
Console.WriteLine($"Main thread ID: {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}");
var task = Task.Factory.StartNew(Greet, "Hello");
Console.WriteLine($"Before task.Result: {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}");
task.Wait(TimeSpan.FromMinutes(5)); // Wait for task to complete.
Console.WriteLine($"After task.Result: {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}");

void Greet(object state)
{
    Thread.Sleep(3000);
    Console.WriteLine(state);
}
//OUTPUT
Main thread ID: 1
Before task.Result  thread ID: 1
Hello
After task.Result thread ID: 1
Main thread.

```
This avoids the cost of the closure required for executing a lambda expression that calls Greet. This is a micro-optimization and is rarely necessary in practice, so we can put the state object to better use, which is to assign a meaningful name to the task. We can then use the `AsyncState` property to query its name:
```c#
var task = Task.Factory.StartNew (state => Greet ("Hello"), "Greeting");
Console.WriteLine (task.AsyncState); // Greeting
task.Wait();
void Greet (string message) { Console.Write (message); }

```

# TaskCreationOptions
You can tune a task’s execution by specifying a TaskCreationOptions enum when calling StartNew (or instantiating a Task). TaskCreationOptions is a flags enum with the following (combinable) values:
## LongRunning
`LongRunning` suggests that the scheduler dedicate a thread to the task, and as we described in Chapter 14, this is beneficial for I/O-bound tasks and for long-running tasks that might otherwise force short-running tasks to wait an unreasonable amount of time before being scheduled.
This option is useful when you have a task that will take a long time to complete and you want to `run it on a dedicated thread`
```c#
Task.Run(() => {
    Console.WriteLine("This task represents a long-running operation and will run on a dedicated thread");
}, TaskCreationOptions.LongRunning);

```
## PreferFairness
`PreferFairness` instructs the scheduler to try to `ensure that tasks are scheduled in the order in which they were started`. 
It might ordinarily do otherwise because it internally optimizes the scheduling of tasks using `local work-stealing queues`—an optimization that allows the creation of child tasks without incurring the contention overhead that would otherwise arise with a single work queue. A child task is created by specifying AttachedToParent.

```c#
static void Main(string[] args) 
{
    var tasks = new List<Task>();

    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    {
        int taskNum = i;
        var task = Task.Factory.StartNew(() =>
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Task {taskNum} started");
            Task.Delay(1000).Wait();
            Console.WriteLine($"Task {taskNum} completed");
        }, TaskCreationOptions.PreferFairness);

        tasks.Add(task);
    }

    Task.WaitAll(tasks.ToArray());
    Console.WriteLine("All tasks completed");
    Console.ReadKey();
}

```
## AttachedToParent
When one task starts another, you can optionally establish a parent-child relationship:
```C#

Task parentTask = Task.Factory.StartNew(() =>
{
    Console.WriteLine("Parent task started");
    Task childTask = Task.Factory.StartNew(() =>
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Child task started");
        Thread.Sleep(2000);
    }, TaskCreationOptions.AttachedToParent);
});
parentTask.Wait(); // Wait for the parent task and its child task to complete
Console.WriteLine("Complete");
Console.ReadLine();
//OUTPUT
Parent task started
Child task started
Complete

```
- If options is NONE

```c#
Task parentTask = Task.Factory.StartNew(() =>
{
    Console.WriteLine("Parent task started");
    Task childTask = Task.Factory.StartNew(() =>
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Child task started");
        Thread.Sleep(2000);
    }, TaskCreationOptions.None);
});
parentTask.Wait(); // Wait for the parent task and its child task to complete
Console.WriteLine("Complete");
Console.ReadLine();
//OUTPUT
Parent task started
Complete
Child task started

```
A child task is special in that when you wait for the parent task to complete, it waits for any children, as well. At which point any child exceptions bubble up:
```c#
TaskCreationOptions atp = TaskCreationOptions.AttachedToParent;
var parent = Task.Factory.StartNew(() =>
{
    Task.Factory.StartNew(() => // Child
    {
        Task.Factory.StartNew(() => { throw null; }, atp);
    }, atp);
});
// Grandchild
// The following call throws a NullReferenceException (wrapped // in nested AggregateExceptions):
parent.Wait();
```
In the example, a child task is created under the parent task, which in turn creates a grandchild task. The grandchild task is set up to throw a `NullReferenceException` using the throw null syntax.

When the parent task is awaited, it will wait for the child task to complete, which will then wait for the grandchild task to complete. When the grandchild task throws the `NullReferenceException`, this exception will bubble up to the parent task and be wrapped in an AggregateException. This behavior is useful because it allows any exceptions thrown by child tasks to be automatically propagated to the parent task, which can then handle them appropriately.

# RunContinuationsAsynchronously
 This option is useful when you want to ensure that task continuations are executed asynchronously. Here's an example:
```c#
Task.Run(() => {
    Console.WriteLine("This task will run asynchronously");
}).ContinueWith(task => {
    Console.WriteLine("This continuation will run asynchronously", TaskContinuationOptions.RunContinuationsAsynchronously);
});

```
# Waiting on Multiple Tasks

We saw in Chapter 14 that you can wait on a single task either by calling its Wait method or accessing its Result property (if it’s a Task<TResult>). You can also wait on multiple tasks at once—via the static methods Task.WaitAll (waits for all the specified tasks to finish) and Task.WaitAny (waits for just one task to finish).

WaitAll is similar to waiting out each task in turn, but is more efficient in that it requires (at most) just one context switch. Also, if one or more of the tasks throw an unhandled exception, WaitAll still waits out every task. It then rethrows an AggregateException that accumulates the exceptions from each faulted task (this is where AggregateException is genuinely useful). It’s equivalent to doing this:

```c#
   // Assume t1, t2 and t3 are tasks:
    var exceptions = new List<Exception>();
    try { t1.Wait(); } catch (AggregateException ex) { exceptions.Add (ex); }
    try { t2.Wait(); } catch (AggregateException ex) { exceptions.Add (ex); }
    try { t3.Wait(); } catch (AggregateException ex) { exceptions.Add (ex); }
    if (exceptions.Count > 0) throw new AggregateException (exceptions);
```
Calling WaitAny is equivalent to waiting on a ManualResetEventSlim that’s signaled by each task as it finishes.
As well as a timeout, `you can also pass in a cancellation token to the Wait methods: this lets you cancel the wait—not the task itself.`
