# Optimizations Completing synchronously
An asynchronous function can return before awaiting. Consider the following method that caches the downloading of web pages:
```c#
    static Dictionary<string,string> _cache = new Dictionary<string,string>();
    async Task<string> GetWebPageAsync (string uri)
    {
      string html;
      if (_cache.TryGetValue (uri, out html)) return html; return _cache [uri] =
        await new WebClient().DownloadStringTaskAsync (uri); }
```
Should a URI already exist in the cache, execution returns to the caller with no awaiting having occurred, and the method returns an already-signaled task. This is referred to as synchronous completion.
When you await a synchronously completed task, execution does not return to the caller and bounce back via a continuation; instead, it proceeds immediately to the next statement. The compiler implements this optimization by checking the IsCompleted property on the awaiter; in other words, whenever you await
    Console.WriteLine (await GetWebPageAsync ("http://oreilly.com"));
the compiler emits code to short-circuit the continuation in case of synchronization completion:
```c#
var awaiter = GetWebPageAsync().GetAwaiter();
if (awaiter.IsCompleted) Console.WriteLine (awaiter.GetResult());
    else
      awaiter.OnCompleted (() => Console.WriteLine (awaiter.GetResult());
```
Awaiting an asynchronous function that returns synchro‐ nously still incurs a (very) small overhead—maybe 20 nano‐ seconds on a 2019-era PC.
In contrast, bouncing to the thread pool introduces the cost of a context switch—perhaps one or two microseconds—and bouncing to a UI message loop, at least 10 times that (much longer if the UI thread is busy).

It’s even legal to write asynchronous methods that never await, although the com‐ piler will generate a warning:
    async Task<string> Foo() { return "abc"; }
Such methods can be useful when overriding virtual/abstract methods, if your implementation doesn’t happen to need asynchrony. (An example is MemoryStream’s ReadAsync/WriteAsync methods; see Chapter 15.) Another way to achieve the same result is to use `Task.FromResult`, which returns an already-signaled task:
```c#
Task<string> Foo() { return Task.FromResult ("abc"); }
```

Caching the Task<string> object instead of the real data (i.e., the downloaded web page as a string) allows us to avoid redundant downloads of the same web page, while also avoiding the need for locks or other synchronization constructs to protect the cache.

If we cached the real data (i.e., the downloaded web page), we would need to synchronize access to the cache in case multiple threads were trying to download the same web page simultaneously. This would introduce unnecessary overhead and complexity in our code, especially if the same web page is being requested frequently.

By caching the Task<string> object instead, we can safely return the same task to all callers requesting the same URI, ensuring that redundant downloads of the same web page are avoided. This is because a Task object represents a unit of work that is either in progress, completed successfully, or completed with an error, and can be shared safely among multiple consumers.

When a caller awaits the Task<string> object returned by GetWebPageAsync method, it will be suspended until the task completes. If the task has already completed, the caller will resume execution immediately without having to wait. If the task is in progress, the caller will be added to the list of continuations that will be executed when the task completes. This ensures that we avoid redundant downloads of the same web page while also minimizing the overhead and complexity of our code.

```c#
 static Dictionary<string,Task<string>> _cache =
       new Dictionary<string,Task<string>>();
    Task<string> GetWebPageAsync (string uri)
    {
      if (_cache.TryGetValue (uri, out var downloadTask)) return downloadTask;
      return _cache [uri] = new WebClient().DownloadStringTaskAsync (uri);
    }
```
(Notice that we don’t mark the method as async, because we’re directly returning the task we obtain from calling WebClient’s method.)
If we call GetWebPageAsync repeatedly with the same URI, we’re now guaranteed to get the same Task<string> object back.` (This has the additional benefit of minimizing garbage collection load.) And if the task is complete, awaiting it is cheap, thanks to the compiler optimization that we just discussed.`
We could further extend our example to make it thread-safe without the protection of a synchronization context, by locking around the entire method body:

```c#

 Dictionary<int, Task<int>> _cache = new Dictionary<int, Task<int>>();

 async Task<int> GetResultAsync(int key)
{
 if (_cache.TryGetValue(key, out var resultTask))
 {
  Console.WriteLine($"Using cached result for key: {key}");
  return await resultTask;
 }
        
 Console.WriteLine($"Starting new operation for key: {key}");
 _cache[key] = LongRunningOperationAsync(key);
 return 1;
}

 async Task<int> LongRunningOperationAsync(int key)
{
 Console.WriteLine($"Long running operation started for key: {key}");
 await Task.Delay(5000); // Simulate a long-running operation
 Console.WriteLine($"Long running operation completed for key: {key}");
 return key * 2;
}
 int result = await GetResultAsync(1);
 int result2 = await GetResultAsync(1);
Console.ReadLine();
```

We could further extend our example to make it thread-safe without the protection of a synchronization context, by locking around the entire method body:
```c#
  lock (_cache)
      if (_cache.TryGetValue (uri, out var downloadTask))
        return downloadTask;
      else
        return _cache [uri] = new WebClient().DownloadStringTaskAsync (uri);
    }

```

This works because we’re not locking for the duration of downloading a page (which would hurt concurrency); we’re locking for the small duration of checking the cache, starting a new task if necessary, and updating the cache with that task.
