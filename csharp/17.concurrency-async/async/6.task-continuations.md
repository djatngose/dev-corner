# Continuations
The ContinueWith method executes a delegate immediately after a task ends:
```c#
Task task1 = Task.Factory.StartNew (() => Console.Write ("antecedant.."));
Task task2 = task1.ContinueWith (ant => Console.Write ("..continuation"));
```

As soon as task1 (the antecedent)` completes, fails, or is canceled,` task2 (the continuation) starts. (If task1 had completed before the second line of code ran, task2 would be scheduled to execute immediately.) The ant argument passed to the continuation’s lambda expression is a reference to the antecedent task. ContinueWith itself returns a task, making it easy to add further continuations.



A continuation says to a task, “When you’ve finished, continue by doing something else.” A continuation is usually implemented by a callback that executes once upon completion of an operation. There are two ways to attach a continuation to a task. The first is particularly significant because it’s used by C#’s asynchronous functions, as you’ll see soon. 
```c#
Task<int> primeNumberTask = Task.Run (async () =>
 {
  await Task.Delay(5000);
  return Enumerable.Range(2, 3000000).Count(n =>
   Enumerable.Range(2, (int)Math.Sqrt(n) - 1).All(i => n % i > 0));
 }
);

var awaiter = primeNumberTask.GetAwaiter();
awaiter.OnCompleted (() =>
{
 Console.WriteLine("Get result");
 int result = awaiter.GetResult();
 Console.WriteLine (result);       // Writes result
});

```
Calling GetAwaiter on the task returns an awaiter object whose OnCompleted method tells the antecedent task (primeNumberTask) to execute a delegate when it finishes (or faults). It’s valid to attach a continuation to an already-completed task, in which case the continuation will be scheduled to execute right away.
```c#
Task<int> antecedent = Task.Run(() => { throw new Exception("Antecedent faulted.");
 return 1;
});
Task continuation = antecedent.ContinueWith(task =>
{
 // var a = task.GetAwaiter().GetResult();
 Console.WriteLine($"Continuation ran with result {task.Exception}.");
});
```

If a synchronization context is present, OnCompleted automatically captures it and posts the continuation to that context. This is very useful in rich client applications because it bounces the continuation back to the UI thread. In writing libraries, how‐ ever, it’s not usually desirable because the relatively expensive UI-thread-bounce should occur just once upon leaving the library rather than between method calls. Hence, you can defeat it by using the `ConfigureAwait` method:
```c#
    var awaiter = primeNumberTask.ConfigureAwait (false).GetAwaiter();
```
`If no synchronization context is present—or you use ConfigureAwait(false)—the continuation will (in general) execute on the same thread as the antecedent, avoiding unnecessary overhead.`
The other way to attach a continuation is by calling the task’s ContinueWith method:
```c#
    primeNumberTask.ContinueWith (antecedent =>
    {
int result = antecedent.Result;
      Console.WriteLine (result);          // Writes 123
    });
```

```c#
Task<int> firstTask = Task.Run(async () =>
{
 Console.WriteLine("Running first task on thread " + Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId);
 await Task.Delay(4000);
 return 42;
});

Task<string> secondTask = firstTask.ContinueWith(previousTask =>
{
 Console.WriteLine("Running second task on thread " + Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId);
 int result = previousTask.Result;
 return "The answer is " + result.ToString();
});

Console.WriteLine("Main thread continues to execute other tasks...");

//OUTPUT
Main thread continues to execute other tasks...
Running first task on thread 6
Running second task on thread 8
The answer is 42

```
`ContinueWith` itself returns a Task, which is useful if you want to attach further continuations. However, you must deal directly with AggregateException if the task faults, and write extra code to marshal the continuation in UI applications (see “Task Schedulers” on page 939). And in non-UI contexts, you must specify TaskContinuationOptions.ExecuteSynchronously if you want the continuation to execute on the same thread; otherwise it will bounce to the thread pool. Continue With is particularly useful in parallel programming scenarios;

# Execute on the same thread
`By default`, antecedent and continuation tasks may execute on `different threads`.

You can force them to execute on the same thread by specifying `TaskContinuation Options.ExecuteSynchronously` when calling ContinueWith: this can improve performance in very fine-grained continuations by lessening indirection.

# Continuations and Task<TResult>
Just like ordinary `tasks`, continuations can be of type `Task<TResult> and return data`. In the following example, we calculate `Math.Sqrt(8*2) `using a series of chained tasks and then write out the result:

```c#
Task.Factory.StartNew<int> (() => 8)
  .ContinueWith (ant => ant.Result * 2)
  .ContinueWith (ant => Math.Sqrt (ant.Result))
  .ContinueWith (ant => Console.WriteLine (ant.Result));
// 4
```
# Continuations and exceptions

A continuation can know whether an antecedent faulted by querying the antecedent task’s Exception property—or simply by invoking Result / Wait and catching the resultant AggregateException. If an antecedent faults and the continuation does neither, the exception is considered unobserved, and the static TaskScheduler.Unob servedTaskException event fires when the task is later garbage collected.
  - In the context of continuations in the Task Parallel Library, an antecedent is a task that has already started, and a continuation is a task that starts after the antecedent completes.
  - `If an antecedent task faults and the continuation does not handle the exception, it is considered unobserved.` This means that the exception is not handled by the continuation, nor is it propagated up the call stack. If the task is later `garbage collected before the exception is handled`, the static T`askScheduler.UnobservedTaskException` event will be raised. It is therefore important to always handle exceptions that can be thrown by tasks, including those thrown by antecedent tasks in continuations.


## Rethrown back to caller
A safe pattern is to rethrow antecedent exceptions. As long as the continuation is Waited upon, the exception will be propagated and rethrown to the Waiter:

```c#
   Task continuation = Task.Factory.StartNew(() =>
    {
     throw null;
    })
    .ContinueWith(ant =>
    {
        ant.Wait();
        // Continue processing...
    });
continuation.Wait(); // Exception is now thrown back to caller.

```
In the provided code snippet, a Task continuation is created that throws a `NullReferenceException`. This Task is then continued with another task using ContinueWith. The continuation waits for the antecedent task to complete before continuing with its own processing.

Since the antecedent task throws an exception, the continuation will throw an exception as well. However, in the provided code, the exception is not caught by the continuation but instead propagated to the caller. This means that if the caller of continuation.Wait() does not handle the exception, it will be thrown back to the higher level in the call stack.

So the phrase `"Exception is now thrown back to caller"` means that the exception thrown by the antecedent task is now propagated back to the caller of the continuation.Wait() method, which can then handle or propagate the exception further up the call stack.

Another way to deal with exceptions is to `specify different continuations for exceptional versus nonexceptional outcomes`. This is done with TaskContinuation Options:
```c#
Task task1 = Task.Factory.StartNew(() => { Console.WriteLine("ahaaha"); });
Task error = task1.ContinueWith(ant => 
  Console.Write(ant.Exception),
TaskContinuationOptions.OnlyOnFaulted);
Task ok = task1.ContinueWith(ant =>
  Console.Write("Success!"),
TaskContinuationOptions.NotOnFaulted
```
This pattern is particularly useful in conjunction with child tasks, as you’ll see very soon.
The following extension method “swallows” a task’s unhandled exceptions:
```c#
    public static void IgnoreExceptions (this Task task)
    {
      task.ContinueWith (t => { var ignore = t.Exception; },
        TaskContinuationOptions.OnlyOnFaulted);
}
```
(This could be improved by adding code to log the exception.) Here’s how it would be used:
```c#
    Task.Factory.StartNew (() => { throw null; }).IgnoreExceptions();
```

# Continuations and child tasks
A powerful feature of continuations is that they kick off only when all child tasks have completed (see Figure 22-5). At that point, any exceptions thrown by the children are marshaled to the continuation.
In the following example, we start three child tasks, each throwing a NullRef erenceException. We then catch all of them in one fell swoop via a continuation on the parent:
```c#
TaskCreationOptions atp = TaskCreationOptions.AttachedToParent;
Task.Factory.StartNew(() =>
    {
        Task.Factory.StartNew(() => { throw null; }, atp);
        Task.Factory.StartNew(() => { throw null; }, atp);
        Task.Factory.StartNew(() => { throw null; }, atp);
    })
    .ContinueWith(p => Console.WriteLine($"got error: {p.Exception}"),
        TaskContinuationOptions.OnlyOnFaulted);

```
When a parent task has child tasks, the parent task can create a continuation task that will execute only after all child tasks have completed. The continuation task will receive all exceptions that were thrown by the child tasks, if any.

When we say the exceptions are "marshaled" to the continuation, it means that they are passed along to the continuation so that it can handle them if necessary. The continuation will receive the exceptions as if they were thrown by the continuation itself, allowing it to handle them in a uniform way regardless of which child task actually threw them.

# ContinueWhenAll
ContinueWhenAll is a method that allows you to specify a collection of antecedent tasks and a continuation action that will execute when all the antecedent tasks have completed. 
```c#
Task<int>[] tasks = new Task<int>[]
{
 Task.Run(() =>
 {
  Thread.Sleep(5000);
  return 1;
 }),
 Task.Run(() =>2),
 Task.Run(() =>3)
};

Task continuationTask = Task.Factory.ContinueWhenAll(tasks, antecedentTasks =>
{
 int sum = 0;
 foreach (var task in antecedentTasks)
 {
  sum += task.Result;
 }
 Console.WriteLine($"The sum is {sum}");
});
//OUTPUT
The sum is 6
```
-` When all with exceptions`:
```c#
```c#
Task<int>[] tasks = new Task<int>[]
{
    Task.Run(() => DoWork1()),
    Task.Run(() => DoWork2()),
    Task.Run(() => DoWork3())
};

Task continuationTask = Task.Factory.ContinueWhenAll(tasks, antecedentTasks =>
{
    foreach (var task in antecedentTasks)
    {
        if (task.Exception != null)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"An exception occurred: {task.Exception.InnerException.Message}");
        }
        else
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"The result is {task.Result}");
        }
    }
});

continuationTask.Wait();

```
```

# Multiple continuations
It allow you to specify more than one continuation action for a single antecedent task. This `can be useful if you want to execute different actions based on the outcome of the antecedent task`, such as handling different exceptions or processing different results.
```c#
Task<int> task = Task.Run(() => DoWork());

Task continuation1 = task.ContinueWith(antecedentTask =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Continuation 1: The result is {antecedentTask.Result}");
});

Task continuation2 = task.ContinueWith(antecedentTask =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Continuation 2: The result is {antecedentTask.Result}");
});

Task continuation3 = task.ContinueWith(antecedentTask =>
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Continuation 3: The result is {antecedentTask.Result}");
});

Task.WaitAll(continuation1, continuation2, continuation3);

```
# ContinueWhenAny 
It is another method that allows you to specify a collection of antecedent tasks, but the continuation action will execute as soon as any one of the antecedent tasks completes.

```c#
var tasks = new List<Task<int>>();
var cancellationTokenSource = new CancellationTokenSource();

for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++)
{
    int j = i; // need to use a local variable to capture the value of i for each task
    tasks.Add(Task.Run(async () =>
    {
        await Task.Delay(j * 1000);
        if (j == 3)
        {
            cancellationTokenSource.Cancel();
        }
        return j;
    }));
}

var firstCompletedTask = await Task.WhenAny(tasks);

await firstCompletedTask.ContinueWith(t =>
{
    if (t.IsCanceled)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("The first task was canceled.");
    }
    else if (t.IsFaulted)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"The first task threw an exception: {t.Exception.InnerException.Message}");
    }
    else
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"The first task completed successfully with result: {t.Result}");
    }
}, cancellationTokenSource.Token);

```
In this example, we create a list of tasks that each return an integer value after a delay. We use Task.WhenAny to wait for the first task to complete, and then we use ContinueWhenAny to execute a continuation that prints a message indicating whether the first task completed successfully, threw an exception, or was canceled.

We also pass in a cancellation token to the continuation so that it will be canceled if the cancellationTokenSource is canceled before the first task completes. In this example, we cancel the token when the third task completes, so the continuation will be canceled if the third task is the first to complete.

# Conditional continuations
By default, a continuation is scheduled unconditionally, whether the antecedent completes, throws an exception, or is canceled. You can alter this behavior via a set of (combinable) flags included within the `TaskContinuationOptions` enum. Following are the three core flags that control conditional continuation:
```c#
    NotOnRanToCompletion = 0x10000,
    NotOnFaulted = 0x20000,
    NotOnCanceled = 0x40000,
```
These flags are subtractive in the sense that the more you apply, the less likely the continuation is to execute. For convenience, there are also the following precom‐ bined values:
- `OnlyOnRanToCompletion` = NotOnFaulted | NotOnCanceled
  - “RanToCompletion” means that the antecedent succeeded without cancellation or unhandled exceptions.
- `OnlyOnFaulted` = NotOnRanToCompletion | NotOnCanceled,
  - “Faulted” means that an unhandled exception was thrown on the antecedent.
- `OnlyOnCanceled` = NotOnRanToCompletion | NotOnFaulted
  - The antecedent was canceled via its cancellation token. In other words, an OperationCanceledException was thrown on the antecedent, whose Cancella tionToken property matched that passed to the antecedent when it was started.
  - The antecedent was implicitly canceled because it didn’t satisfy a conditional continuation predicate.

(Combining all the Not* flags [NotOnRanToCompletion, NotOnFaulted, NotOn Canceled] is nonsensical because it would result in the continuation always being canceled.)

It’s essential to grasp that when a continuation doesn’t execute by virtue of these flags, the continuation is not forgotten or abandoned—it’s canceled. This means that any continuations on the continuation itself will then run unless you predicate them with NotOnCanceled. For example, consider this:

```c#
Task t1 = Task.Factory.StartNew(() =>
{
 throw new Exception("failed t1");
});
Task fault = t1.ContinueWith(ant =>
  Console.WriteLine("fault"),
    TaskContinuationOptions.OnlyOnFaulted);
Task t3 = fault.ContinueWith(ant => Console.WriteLine("t3"));

```
As it stands, t3 will always get scheduled—even if t1 doesn’t throw an exception (see Figure 22-6). This is because if t1 succeeds, the fault task will be canceled, and with no continuation restrictions placed on t3, t3 will then execute unconditionally.

If we want t3 to execute only if fault actually runs, we must instead do this:
```c#
Task t3 = fault.ContinueWith (ant => Console.WriteLine ("t3"),
TaskContinuationOptions.NotOnCanceled);
```
(Alternatively, we could specify `OnlyOnRanToCompletion`; the difference is that t3
would not then execute if an exception were thrown within fault.)

# Continuations with multiple antecedents

You can schedule continuation to execute based on the completion of multiple antecedents with the ContinueWhenAll and ContinueWhenAny methods in the Task Factory class. These methods have become redundant, however, with the introduc‐ tion of the task combinators discussed in Chapter 14 (WhenAll and WhenAny). Specifically, given the following tasks:
```c#
    var task1 = Task.Run (() => Console.Write ("X"));
    var task2 = Task.Run (() => Console.Write ("Y"));
```
we can schedule a continuation to execute when both complete as follows:
```c#
    var continuation = Task.Factory.ContinueWhenAll (
      new[] { task1, task2 }, tasks => Console.WriteLine ("Done"));
```
Here’s the same result with the WhenAll task combinator:
```c#
 var continuation = Task.WhenAll (task1, task2)
                           .ContinueWith (ant => Console.WriteLine ("Done"));
```                           
# Multiple continuations on a single antecedent

Calling ContinueWith more than once on the same task creates multiple contin‐ uations on a single antecedent. When the antecedent finishes, all continuations will start together (unless you specify T`askContinuationOptions.ExecuteSynchro nously`, in which case the continuations will execute sequentially).
The following waits for one second and then writes either XY or YX:
```c#
  var t = Task.Factory.StartNew (() => Thread.Sleep (1000));
    t.ContinueWith (ant => Console.Write ("X"));
    t.ContinueWith (ant => Console.Write ("Y"));
```
