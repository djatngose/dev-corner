# Locking and Thread Safety

We can fix the previous example by obtaining an exclusive lock while reading and writing to the shared field. C# provides the lock statement for just this purpose:
```c#
    class ThreadSafe
    {
      static bool _done;
      static readonly object _locker = new object();
      static void Main()
      {
        new Thread (Go).Start();
Go(); }
      static void Go()
      {
        lock (_locker)
        {
          if (!_done) { Console.WriteLine ("Done"); _done = true; }
}
} }
```
When two threads simultaneously contend a lock (which can be upon any reference-type object; in this case, _locker), one thread waits, or blocks, until the lock becomes available. In this case, it ensures that only one thread can enter its code block at a time, and “Done” will be printed just once. Code that’s protected in such a manner—from indeterminacy in a multithreaded context—is called thread safe.

`Locking is not a silver bullet for thread safety—it’s easy to forget to lock around accessing a field, and locking can create problems of its own (such as deadlocking).`
