# Deadlocks
A deadlock happens when `two threads each wait for a resource held by the other, so neither can proceed`. The easiest way to illustrate this is with two locks:
```c#
object locker1 = new object();
object locker2 = new object();
new Thread (() => {
lock (locker2)
{
}
Thread.Sleep (1000);
lock (locker1);
  lock (locker1)
  {
    Thread.Sleep (1000);
    lock (locker2);
  }
}).Start();
// Deadlock
// Deadlock
```
You can create more elaborate deadlocking chains with three or more threads.

`Note`: the `CLR`, in a standard hosting environment, is `not like SQL Server and does not automatically detect and resolve deadlocks by terminating one of the offenders`. A threading deadlock causes participating threads to block indefinitely, unless you’ve specified a locking timeout. (Under the SQL CLR integration host, however, deadlocks are automatically detected, and a [catchable] exception is thrown on one of the threads.)
Deadlocking is one of the most difficult problems in multithreading—especially when there are many interrelated objects. Fundamentally, the hard problem is that you can’t be sure what locks your caller has taken out.
So, you might lock private field a within your class x, unaware that your caller (or caller’s caller) has already locked field b within class y. Meanwhile, another thread is doing the reverse—creating a deadlock. Ironically, the problem is exacerbated by (good) object-oriented design patterns, because such patterns create call chains that are not determined until runtime.
The popular advice “lock objects in a consistent order to prevent deadlocks,” although helpful in our initial example, is difficult to apply to the scenario just described. A better strategy is to be wary of locking around calls to methods in objects that might have references back to your own object. Also, consider whether you really need to lock around calls to methods in other classes (often you do—as you’ll see in “Locking and Thread Safety” on page 874—but sometimes there are other options). Relying more on higher-level synchronization options such as

```c#
class Program {
    static readonly object lockObj1 = new object();
    static readonly object lockObj2 = new object();

    static void Main(string[] args) {
        // Start two threads that both call the functions in a different order
        var thread1 = new Thread(Thread1Function);
        var thread2 = new Thread(Thread2Function);
        thread1.Start();
        thread2.Start();

        // Wait for both threads to finish
        thread1.Join();
        thread2.Join();
    }

    static void Thread1Function() {
        lock (lockObj1) {
            Console.WriteLine($"Thread 1 acquired lockObj1.");
            // Sleep for a second to give Thread 2 a chance to acquire lockObj2
            Thread.Sleep(1000);

            lock (lockObj2) {
                Console.WriteLine($"Thread 1 acquired lockObj2.");
                // Do some work
                Console.WriteLine("Thread 1 doing some work...");

                Console.WriteLine($"Thread 1 releasing lockObj2.");
            }

            Console.WriteLine($"Thread 1 releasing lockObj1.");
        }
    }

    static void Thread2Function() {
        lock (lockObj2) {
            Console.WriteLine($"Thread 2 acquired lockObj2.");
            // Sleep for a second to give Thread 1 a chance to acquire lockObj1
            Thread.Sleep(1000);

            lock (lockObj1) {
                Console.WriteLine($"Thread 2 acquired lockObj1.");
                // Do some work
                Console.WriteLine("Thread 2 doing some work...");

                Console.WriteLine($"Thread 2 releasing lockObj1.");
            }

            Console.WriteLine($"Thread 2 releasing lockObj2.");
        }
    }
}

```

In this example, we have two threads thread1 and thread2 that both try to acquire two different locks in a different order. Thread1Function() first acquires lockObj1, sleeps for a second to give Thread2Function() a chance to acquire lockObj2, and then tries to acquire lockObj2. Thread2Function() does the opposite - first acquires lockObj2, sleeps for a second, and then tries to acquire lockObj1.

If these threads are executed concurrently, it's possible for a deadlock to occur. For example, let's say that thread1 starts executing Thread1Function() and acquires lockObj1. At the same time, thread2 starts executing Thread2Function() and acquires lockObj2. Now, thread1 tries to acquire lockObj2 and blocks because it is already held by thread2. Similarly, thread2 tries to acquire lockObj1 and blocks because it is already held by thread1. Both threads are now waiting for the other to release the lock, resulting in a deadlock.

# Best practices to avoid deadlock

- `Use a consistent locking order`: When multiple locks are acquired, they should always be acquired in the same order to avoid potential deadlocks. This means that all threads should acquire locks in the same order, and any objects or resources that are locked should be accessed in the same order across all threads.

```c#
public class BankAccount
{
    private object lock1 = new object();
    private object lock2 = new object();
    private decimal balance = 0;

    public void Transfer(BankAccount destination, decimal amount)
    {
        if (this == destination)
        {
            throw new ArgumentException("Cannot transfer money to the same account");
        }

        // Acquire locks in a consistent order to prevent deadlock
        if (this.GetHashCode() < destination.GetHashCode())
        {
            lock (lock1)
            {
                lock (lock2)
                {
                    this.balance -= amount;
                    destination.balance += amount;
                }
            }
        }
        else
        {
            lock (lock2)
            {
                lock (lock1)
                {
                    this.balance -= amount;
                    destination.balance += amount;
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

```
In this example, the BankAccount class uses two locks (lock1 and lock2) to prevent concurrent access to the account balance. The Transfer method acquires the locks in a consistent order based on the hash code of the accounts to prevent deadlock.

- `Avoid long-running operations within lock blocks`: If a long-running operation is performed within a lock block, it can cause other threads to wait for an extended period of time, which can increase the risk of deadlock. To avoid this, try to keep the critical section of code within lock blocks as short as possible.
```c#
public class Worker
{
    private object lockObj = new object();

    public void DoWork()
    {
        lock (lockObj)
        {
            // Perform a short critical section of code
            Console.WriteLine("Worker is doing some work...");

            // Simulate a long-running operation
            Thread.Sleep(5000);
        }
    }
}

```
In this example, the Worker class performs a short critical section of code within a lock block, followed by a long-running operation that simulates work being done. This can cause other threads to wait for an extended period of time and increase the risk of deadlock. To avoid this, the long-running operation should be moved outside the lock block.

- `Use timeouts and cancellation tokens`: When acquiring locks, it's a good practice to use timeouts and cancellation tokens to prevent threads from waiting indefinitely. If a thread is unable to acquire a lock within a specified timeout period, it should release the lock and try again later.
```c#
public class Resource
{
    private object lockObj = new object();
    private int counter = 0;

    public void DoSomething()
    {
        if (Monitor.TryEnter(lockObj, TimeSpan.FromSeconds(10)))
        {
            try
            {
                // Perform a short critical section of code
                counter++;
            }
            finally
            {
                Monitor.Exit(lockObj);
            }
        }
        else
        {
            throw new TimeoutException("Unable to acquire lock within specified timeout period");
        }
    }
}

```
In this example, the Resource class uses a timeout period of 10 seconds when acquiring the lock to prevent threads from waiting indefinitely. If a thread is unable to acquire the lock within the specified timeout period, it will throw a TimeoutException.
- `Minimize locking and synchronization`: Locking and synchronization can be expensive in terms of performance, so it's important to minimize their use wherever possible. Consider using thread-safe data structures or other synchronization techniques that reduce the need for locks and minimize the risk of deadlock.
```c#
public class ConcurrentQueue<T>
{
    private Queue<T> queue = new Queue<T>();

    public void Enqueue(T item)
    {
        lock (queue)
        {
            queue.Enqueue(item);
        }
    }

    public T Dequeue()
    {
        lock (queue)
        {
            return queue.Dequeue();
        }
    }
}

```
In this example, the ConcurrentQueue class uses a lock to prevent concurrent access to the queue. However, locking and synchronization can be expensive in terms of performance, so it's important to minimize their use wherever possible. Consider using a thread-safe data structure like ConcurrentQueue or other synchronization techniques that reduce the need for locks.

- `Use higher-level synchronization primitives`: In some cases, higher-level synchronization primitives like semaphores, mutexes, or reader-writer locks can be used to reduce the risk of deadlock. These primitives provide more powerful synchronization mechanisms that can help avoid potential deadlocks.
