# Intro
`Wait, Pulse, and spinlocks` are low-level synchronization constructs in C# that are used to coordinate access to shared resources between multiple threads.

`Wait` is a method that causes the calling thread to block and wait until a certain condition is met. It is typically used in conjunction with a lock, where the lock is acquired and then the calling thread waits for a certain condition to be true before releasing the lock.

`Pulse` is a method that unblocks a thread that is waiting on a condition variable. It is typically used in conjunction with Wait to notify waiting threads that the condition they were waiting for has been met.

`Spinlocks` are a type of synchronization construct where a thread repeatedly checks a shared variable to see if a lock is available, rather than blocking and waiting for the lock to be released. `Spinlocks` are typically used in cases where locks are expected to be held for only short periods of time, and where the overhead of blocking and unblocking threads is considered too high.

# How they applied to Barrier class?
In the Barrier class, these constructs are used internally to coordinate the synchronization of threads. The Barrier class uses a combination of Wait and Pulse to coordinate the waiting and signaling of threads. When a thread reaches the barrier, it calls Wait to wait for all other threads to arrive. Once all threads have arrived, the Barrier class uses Pulse to signal all threads to resume execution.

Additionally, the Barrier class uses spinlocks internally to ensure that threads do not proceed past the barrier until all threads have arrived. This is done to minimize the overhead of blocking and unblocking threads, and to maximize the utilization of CPU resources.
