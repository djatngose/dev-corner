# Intro
`Wait, Pulse, and spinlocks` are low-level synchronization constructs in C# that are used to coordinate access to shared resources between multiple threads.

# Wait and Pulse
`Wait` is a method that causes the calling thread to block and wait until a certain condition is met. It is typically used in conjunction with a lock, where the lock is acquired and then the calling thread waits for a certain condition to be true before releasing the lock.

`Pulse` is a method that unblocks a thread that is waiting on a condition variable. It is typically used in conjunction with Wait to notify waiting threads that the condition they were waiting for has been met.

When a thread calls `Monitor.Wait` on an object, it enters a wait state until another thread calls `Monitor.Pulse` on the same object. When this happens, the waiting thread is moved from the wait state to the ready state and becomes eligible to be scheduled for execution by the operating system.

`Monitor.Pulse` signals the waiting thread to check the condition that caused it to enter the wait state. If the condition has not been satisfied, the waiting thread can call `Monitor.Wait` again to re-enter the wait state.

It's important to note that `Monitor.Pulse` does not release the lock on the object that the waiting thread is waiting on. This means that the signaling thread must release the lock by exiting the critical section or by calling `Monitor.Exit` explicitly.

```c#
        object _lockObj = new object();
        int _queueSize = 10;
        int[] _queue = new int[_queueSize];
        int _count = 0;

        
        var consumerThread = new Thread(Consume);
        var producerThread = new Thread(Produce);
        
        producerThread.Start();
        consumerThread.Start();

        producerThread.Join();
        consumerThread.Join();

        Console.ReadLine();

        void Produce()
        {
            for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++)
            {
                lock (_lockObj)
                {
                    while (_count == _queueSize)
                    {
                        Monitor.Wait(_lockObj);
                    }

                    _queue[_count++] = i;
                    Console.WriteLine($"Produced {i}");

                    Monitor.Pulse(_lockObj);
                }
            }
        }

        void Consume()
        {
            while (true)
            {
                lock (_lockObj)
                {
                    while (_count == 0)
                    {
                        Monitor.Wait(_lockObj);
                    }

                    int item = _queue[--_count];
                    Console.WriteLine($"Consumed {item}");

                    Monitor.Pulse(_lockObj);
                }

                Thread.Sleep(1000);
            }
        }

# We we need to use lock before using Wait or Pulse?
Yes, before calling Wait() or Pulse() methods of the Monitor class, it is necessary to obtain the lock of the object that we want to synchronize on. This is because the Wait() and Pulse() methods operate on the synchronization object's internal state and need to be synchronized with other threads that are accessing the same object. If the lock is not obtained before calling these methods, it may result in unpredictable behavior or race conditions

# what difference Monitor.Pulse() vs Monitor.PulseAll()?

In multithreaded programming, `Monitor.Pulse()` and `Monitor.PulseAll()` are used to wake up one or more threads that are waiting on a specific object. Both methods are used in combination with Monitor.Wait() to implement a producer-consumer pattern or other synchronization patterns.

`Monitor.Pulse()` wakes up one waiting thread, chosen by the system, that is waiting on the object. If there are no waiting threads, the call to `Pulse()` has no effect.

`Monitor.PulseAll()` wakes up all the waiting threads that are waiting on the object. If there are no waiting threads, the call to `PulseAll()` has no effect.

In general, `PulseAll()` should be used over `Pulse()` when you have multiple threads waiting for the same resource, and you want to wake them all up at once. If you use` Pulse()` instead, you may wake up only one thread, leaving other threads waiting indefinitely. However, using` PulseAll(`) can also lead to unnecessary context switching and overhead, especially if the waiting threads have to compete for the resource after they wake up.

In the producer-consumer pattern, `Pulse() `is used to signal the consumer thread to wake up and consume a newly produced item, while `PulseAll()` can be used to signal all consumer threads waiting on the same queue to wake up and consume newly produced items. Similarly, in other synchronization patterns, `Pulse() and PulseAll()` can be used to wake up one or all waiting threads, respectively, depending on the specific requirements of the synchronization pattern.

# Spinlocks
`Spinlocks` are a type of synchronization construct where a thread repeatedly checks a shared variable to see if a lock is available, rather than blocking and waiting for the lock to be released. `Spinlocks` are typically used in cases where locks are expected to be held for only short periods of time, and where the overhead of blocking and unblocking threads is considered too high.
# How they applied to Barrier class?
In the `Barrier` class, these constructs are used internally to coordinate the synchronization of threads. The `Barrier` class uses a combination of `Wait and Pulse` to coordinate the waiting and signaling of threads. When a thread reaches the barrier, it calls `Wait` to wait for all other threads to arrive. Once all threads have arrived, the `Barrier` class uses `Pulse` to signal all threads to resume execution.

Additionally, the `Barrier` class uses spinlocks internally to ensure that threads do not proceed past the `barrier` until all threads have arrived. This is done to minimize the overhead of blocking and unblocking threads, and to maximize the utilization of CPU resources.
