# Lambda expressions and captured variables
As we saw, a lambda expression is the most powerful way to pass data to a thread. However, you must be careful about accidentally modifying captured variables after starting the thread, because these variables are shared. For instance, consider the following:
```c#
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
  new Thread (() => Console.Write (i)).Start();
```
The output is nondeterministic! Here’s a typical result:
```c#
0223557799
```

The problem is that the `i variable refers to the same memory location throughout the loop’s lifetime`. Therefore, each thread calls Console.Write on a variable whose value may change as it is running!

# Solution
The solution is to use a temporary variable as follows:
```c#
for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
{
  int temp = i;
  new Thread (() => Console.Write (temp)).Start();
}
```
Variable `temp` is now local to each loop iteration. Therefore, each thread captures a different memory location and there’s no problem. We can illustrate the problem in the earlier code more simply with the following example:
```c#
string text = "t1";
Thread t1 = new Thread ( () => Console.WriteLine (text) );
 
text = "t2";
Thread t2 = new Thread ( () => Console.WriteLine (text) );
 
t1.Start();
t2.Start();
```
Because both lambda expressions capture the same text variable, t2 is printed twice:
```c#
t2 
t2
```
