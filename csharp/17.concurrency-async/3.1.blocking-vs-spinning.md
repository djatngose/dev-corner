# Blocking Versus Spinning
Sometimes a thread must pause until a certain condition is met. Signaling and locking constructs achieve this efficiently by blocking until a condition is satisfied. However, there is a simpler alternative: a thread can await a condition by spinning in a polling loop. For example:
```c#
while (!proceed);
or:

while (DateTime.Now < nextStartTime);
```
In general, this is very wasteful on processor time: as far as the CLR and operating system are concerned, the thread is performing an important calculation, and so gets allocated resources accordingly!

Sometimes a hybrid between blocking and spinning is used:
```c#
while (!proceed) Thread.Sleep (10);
```
Although inelegant, this is (in general) far more efficient than outright spinning. Problems can arise, though, due to concurrency issues on the proceed flag. Proper use of locking and signaling avoids this.

`Note`: `Spinning` very briefly can be effective when you expect a condition to be satisfied soon (perhaps within a few microseconds) because it avoids the overhead and latency of a context switch. The .NET Framework provides special methods and classes to assist â€” these are covered in the parallel programming section.
