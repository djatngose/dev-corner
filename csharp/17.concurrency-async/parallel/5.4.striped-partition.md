# Striped Partitioning –

 This scheme is used for `SkipWhile` and `TakeWhile` and is optimized for processing items at the head of a data source (which obviously suits the needs of SkipWhile and TakeWhile). In striped partitioning, each of the n worker threads is allocated a small number of items (sometimes 1) from each block of n items.  The set of items belonging to a single thread is called a ‘stripe’, hence the name.  A useful feature of this scheme is that there is no inter-thread synchronization required as each worker thread can determine its data via simple arithmetic. This is really a special case of range partitioning and only works on arrays and types that implement IList<T>.

 Striped partitioning is a partitioning scheme that is optimized for processing items at the head of a data source, which is a characteristic that suits the needs of SkipWhile and TakeWhile operators. In striped partitioning, a data source is divided into stripes, where each stripe is a set of items that belong to a single worker thread. Each worker thread is allocated a small number of items (sometimes just one) from each block of n items, where n is the total number of worker threads.

One important advantage of striped partitioning is that there is no inter-thread synchronization required, as each worker thread can determine its data via simple arithmetic. This is because each worker thread is assigned a fixed set of items, based on the total number of worker threads and the total number of items in the data source. This makes striped partitioning a particularly efficient and scalable partitioning scheme for processing data sources that implement the IList<T> interface or are stored as arrays.

To summarize, `striped partitioning is a specialized form of range partitioning` that divides a data source into stripes, where each stripe is a set of items that belongs to a single worker thread. This partitioning scheme is particularly efficient for processing the head of a data source and requires no inter-thread synchronization, making it an attractive option for parallel processing scenarios.
