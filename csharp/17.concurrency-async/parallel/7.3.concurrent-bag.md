# Concurrent bag
`ConcurrentBag<T>` stores an `unordered collection of objects (with duplicates permitted)`. ConcurrentBag<T> is suitable in situations for which you don’t care which element you get when calling Take or TryTake.

`ConcurrentBag<T>` is implemented using an array of linked lists, where each linked list represents a separate thread-local bag. When an item is added to the ConcurrentBag<T>, it is added to the linked list that corresponds to the current thread. When a thread removes an item from the bag, it first tries to remove an item from its own linked list. If its list is empty, it randomly selects another thread's list to remove an item from. This ensures that the load is balanced across all threads using the ConcurrentBag<T>.

# ConcurrentBag vs Concurrent queue/stack
The `benefit` of ConcurrentBag<T> over a concurrent queue or stack is that a bag’s `Add method suffers almost no contention when called by many threads at once`. In contrast, calling Add in parallel on a queue or stack incurs some contention (although a lot less than locking around a nonconcurrent collection). 

Calling `Take` on a concurrent bag is also very efficient as long as each thread doesn’t take more elements than it Added.

# How it works behind the scene?

Inside a concurrent bag, `each thread gets its own private linked list`. Elements are added to the private list that belongs to the thread calling Add, eliminating contention. When you enumerate over the bag, the enumerator travels through each thread’s private list, yielding each of its elements in turn.

When you call `Take`, the bag first looks at the `current thread’s private list`.
  - If there’s at least one element,1 it can complete the task easily and without contention.
  - But if the list is empty, it must `“steal”` an element from another thread’s private list and incur the potential for contention.

So, to be precise, calling `Take` gives you the element added most recently on that thread; if there are no elements on that thread, it gives you the element added most recently on another thread, chosen at random.  

`Concurrent bags` are ideal when the parallel operation on your collection mostly comprises Adding elements—or when the Adds and Takes are balanced on a thread. We saw an example of the former previously, when using Parallel.ForEach to implement a parallel spellchecker:
```c#
   var misspellings = new ConcurrentBag<Tuple<int,string>>();
    Parallel.ForEach (wordsToTest, (word, state, i) =>
    {
      if (!wordLookup.Contains (word))
        misspellings.Add (Tuple.Create ((int) i, word));
});
```
A `concurrent bag` would be a `poor choice for a producer/consumer queue` because elements are added and removed by different threads.

## Deep dive
When multiple threads add items to a `ConcurrentBag`, the bag uses a data structure called a `"lock-free linked list."`
  - It uses an internal linked list of nodes, where each node contains an array of items. Each node is a separate object and contains a fixed number of items (by default, 32), which is determined when the node is created. When an item is added to the bag, it is placed into the last node of the linked list that still has space for new items. If there is no such node, a new node is created and added to the end of the linked list. When an item is removed from the bag, the nodes are searched in reverse order (starting from the end of the linked list) for the first node that contains at least one item, and the item is removed from that node. This design allows for efficient concurrent access to the bag, as threads can add or remove items from different nodes without contention.


In this structure, each node in the list contains a reference to the next node and the value of the item being stored. The bag also maintains a reference to the head of the list.

When an item is added to the bag, a new node is created with the item's value and added to the list. To make this operation thread-safe, the bag uses a compare-and-swap (CAS) operation to update the head of the list. If multiple threads try to add items at the same time, they will all create new nodes and try to update the head of the list. However, only one thread will be successful in updating the head, and the others will retry until they are able to update the list.

Because each thread adds its own node to the linked list, there is no need to lock the entire list while adding an item. This allows for efficient concurrent access to the bag without causing threads to block and wait for each other. When a thread removes an item from the bag, it simply pops the last node off the list, which is guaranteed to be unique due to the nature of the bag's implementation.
