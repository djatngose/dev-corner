# Concurrent stack
ConcurrentStack is implemented as a linked list of nodes, where each node contains a value and a reference to the next node. When a new value is added to the stack, a new node is created and its next reference is set to the current top of the stack. The top of the stack is then updated to point to the new node. Since each node contains a reference to the next node, the stack can be traversed from top to bottom by following the next references. To ensure thread safety, the collection uses atomic operations to modify the top of the stack, eliminating the need for locks.


# How it works behind the scene?
`ConcurrentStack`<T> is a thread-safe collection in .NET that allows multiple threads to push and pop items from a stack simultaneously. It is implemented using a singly-linked list with atomic operations to ensure thread-safety.

The `PushCore` method is called when an item is pushed onto the stack. It takes two arguments: head, which is the node to be pushed, and tail, which is the node currently at the top of the stack.

The method starts by creating a SpinWait object, which is used to wait for a short period of time while spinning in a loop, allowing other threads to complete their operations. The SpinOnce method of the SpinWait object is called repeatedly until the operation can be completed.

Inside the loop, the _next property of the tail node is set to the current head of the stack, which ensures that the new node is added at the top of the stack. The method then uses an atomic CompareExchange operation to set the new head of the stack to the head node.

If the CompareExchange operation fails, the loop continues and the SpinOnce method is called again. If the operation succeeds, the item has been added to the stack and the method returns.

If logging is enabled, the method logs the number of spins performed during the operation.
`Summarize`:
  - `ConcurrentStack` uses a linked list data structure and is designed to be thread-safe for multiple threads to access and modify the stack concurrently. It employs various synchronization techniques such as spin locking, interlocked operations, and volatile reads/writes to ensure thread safety and avoid data corruption. ConcurrentStack provides push, pop, peek, and enumeration operations, all of which are guaranteed to be thread-safe.
