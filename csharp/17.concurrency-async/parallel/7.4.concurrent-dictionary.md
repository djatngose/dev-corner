# Concurrent dictionary
ConcurrentDictionary is implemented as an array of buckets, where each bucket contains a linked list of key-value pairs. When a new key-value pair is added, the hash code of the key is used to determine the bucket where it belongs. Since different keys may produce the same hash code (a phenomenon known as hash collisions), each bucket contains a linked list of key-value pairs rather than a single value. To ensure thread safety, the collection uses fine-grained locks that are acquired only when necessary, minimizing contention among threads.

# How it works behind the scene?

`ConcurrentDictionary` is a thread-safe dictionary that allows multiple threads to read and write to it concurrently without locking the entire dictionary. `It achieves this by partitioning the dictionary into multiple segments, each of which can be accessed independently.`

Internally, `ConcurrentDictionary` is `implemented as an array of buckets, each of which holds a linked list of key-value pairs`. When an item is added or removed, the dictionary uses a hash function to determine which bucket the item belongs to and then performs the add or remove operation on that bucket's linked list.

To ensure thread-safety, the dictionary uses locks on a per-bucket basis. When multiple threads access different buckets, they can do so concurrently. However, when multiple threads access the same bucket, they must take turns acquiring a lock on that bucket to ensure that only one thread modifies it at a time.

In addition to basic add and remove operations, `ConcurrentDictionary` provides many other methods for working with key-value pairs, such as` TryGetValue, AddOrUpdate, and GetOrAdd.` These methods are designed to be thread-safe and are implemented using a combination of locks and atomic operations to ensure that concurrent access does not result in data corruption or race conditions.
