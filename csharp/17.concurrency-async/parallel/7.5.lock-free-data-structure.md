Use lock-free algorithms to ensure that concurrent accesses do not cause any race conditions or deadlocks

Lock-free algorithms are a type of concurrent algorithm that allows multiple threads to access shared data structures without using locks or other blocking synchronization mechanisms. Instead, `lock-free algorithms rely on atomic operations and memory barriers` to ensure that multiple threads can access and modify shared data without interfering with each other.

`Lock-free `algorithms are designed to avoid the problems of traditional locking mechanisms, such as deadlocks and livelocks, which can occur when multiple threads attempt to acquire and release locks in an inconsistent manner. They are often used in high-performance computing scenarios where the overhead of traditional locking mechanisms would be too high.

There are many different lock-free algorithms, each with its own set of trade-offs and performance characteristics. Some common examples include lock-free linked lists, hash tables, and queues.

# Lock-free linked lists
`Lock-free linked lists` use a technique called `"optimistic locking"` to ensure that only one thread modifies a node in the list at a time. Each node in the list is marked with a version number that is incremented each time the node is modified.

When a thread wants to modify a node, `it first reads the version number to check that the node has not been modified by another thread since the last read.`
  - If the version number has not changed, the thread modifies the node and updates the version number.
  - If the version number has changed, the thread retries the operation.

# Lock-free hash tables 
L`ock-free hash tables` use a similar approach, but instead of version numbers, they use atomic `compare-and-swap (CAS) operations` to update the table. When a thread wants to add or remove an element from the table, it first uses a hash function to determine the location in the table where the element should be stored.
- It then uses a CAS operation to try to add or remove the element from the table.
- If another thread has modified the table in the meantime, the CAS operation fails and the thread retries the operation.

# Lock-free queues
`Lock-free queues `are implemented using a technique called `"compare-and-swap pointers"`. Each node in the queue has a "next" pointer that points to the next node in the queue. When a thread wants to add an element to the queue, it creates a new node with a pointer to the element and uses a CAS operation to update the "next" pointer of the last node in the queue to point to the new node. If another thread has added a node to the queue in the meantime, the CAS operation fails and the thread retries the operation.
