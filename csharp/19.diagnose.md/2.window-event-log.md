# Windows Event Logs
The Win32 platform provides a centralized logging mechanism, in the form of the Windows event logs.
The Debug and Trace classes we used earlier write to a Windows event log if you register an EventLogTraceListener. With the EventLog class, however, you can write directly to a Windows event log without using Trace or Debug. You can also use this class to read and monitor event data.

`NOTE`: Writing to the Windows event log makes sense in a Windows Service application, because if something goes wrong, you can’t pop up a user interface directing the user to some spe‐ cial file where diagnostic information has been written. Also, because it’s common practice for services to write to the Win‐ dows event log, this is the first place an administrator is likely to look if your service falls over.

There are three standard Windows event logs, identified by these names:
• Application
• System
• Security
The Application log is where most applications normally write.

# Writing to the Event Log
To write to a Windows event log:
1. Choose one of the three event logs (usually Application).
2. Decide on a source name and create it if necessary (create requires administra‐ tive permissions).
3. Call EventLog.WriteEntry with the log name, source name, and message data.
The source name is an easily identifiable name for your application. You must register a source name before you use it—the CreateEventSource method performs this function. You can then call WriteEntry:
```c#
const string SourceName = "MyCompany.WidgetServer";
    // CreateEventSource requires administrative permissions, so this would
    // typically be done in application setup.
    if (!EventLog.SourceExists (SourceName))
      EventLog.CreateEventSource (SourceName, "Application");
    EventLog.WriteEntry (SourceName,
      "Service started; using configuration file=...",
      EventLogEntryType.Information);
```
EventLogEntryType can be Information, Warning, Error, SuccessAudit, or FailureAudit. Each displays with a different icon in the Windows event viewer. You can also optionally specify a category and event ID (each is a number of your own choosing) and provide optional binary data.
CreateEventSource also allows you to specify a machine name: this is to write to another computer’s event log, if you have sufficient permissions.

# Reading the Event Log
To read an event log, instantiate the EventLog class with the name of the log that you want to access and optionally the name of another computer on which the log resides. Each log entry can then be read via the Entries collection property:
    EventLog log = new EventLog ("Application");
    Console.WriteLine ("Total entries: " + log.Entries.Count);
    EventLogEntry last = log.Entries [log.Entries.Count - 1];
Console.WriteLine ("Index:
Console.WriteLine ("Source:
Console.WriteLine ("Type:
Console.WriteLine ("Time:
Console.WriteLine ("Message: " + last.Message);
" + last.Index);
" + last.Source);
" + last.EntryType); " + last.TimeWritten);
You can enumerate over all logs for the current (or another) computer via the static method EventLog.GetEventLogs (this requires administrative privileges for full access):
    foreach (EventLog log in EventLog.GetEventLogs())
      Console.WriteLine (log.LogDisplayName);
This normally prints, at a minimum, Application, Security, and System.

# Monitoring the Event Log
You can be alerted whenever an entry is written to a Windows event log, via the EntryWritten event. This works for event logs on the local computer, and it fires regardless of what application logged the event.

To enable log monitoring:
```c#
1. Instantiate an EventLog and set its EnableRaisingEvents property to true.
2. Handle the EntryWritten event. For example:
    using (var log = new EventLog ("Application"))
    {
log.EnableRaisingEvents = true; log.EntryWritten += DisplayEntry; Console.ReadLine();
}
    void DisplayEntry (object sender, EntryWrittenEventArgs e)
    {
EventLogEntry entry = e.Entry;
      Console.WriteLine (entry.Message);
    }
```
# Performance Counters

Performance Counters are a Windows-only feature and require the NuGet package System.Diagnostics.Perfor manceCounter. If you’re targeting Linux or macOS, see “Cross- Platform Diagnostic Tools” on page 603 for alternatives.
The logging mechanisms we’ve discussed to date are useful for capturing infor‐ mation for future analysis. However, to gain insight into the current state of an application (or the system as a whole), a more real-time approach is needed. The Win32 solution to this need is the performance-monitoring infrastructure, which consists of a set of performance counters that the system and applications expose, and the Microsoft Management Console (MMC) snap-ins used to monitor these counters in real time.

Performance counters are grouped into categories such as “System,” “Processor,” “.NET CLR Memory,” and so on. These categories are sometimes also referred to as “performance objects” by the graphical user interface (GUI) tools. Each category groups a related set of performance counters that monitor one aspect of the system or application. Examples of performance counters in the “.NET CLR Memory” category include “% Time in GC,” “# Bytes in All Heaps,” and “Allocated bytes/sec.”
Each category can optionally have one or more instances that can be monitored independently. For example, this is useful in the “% Processor Time” performance counter in the “Processor” category, which allows one to monitor CPU utilization. On a multiprocessor machine, this counter supports an instance for each CPU, allowing you to monitor the utilization of each CPU independently.

The following sections illustrate how to perform commonly needed tasks such as determining which counters are exposed, monitoring a counter, and creating your own counters to expose application status information.
Reading performance counters or categories might require administrator privileges on the local or target computer, depending on what is accessed.

# NET performance counters are used for?
.NET performance counters are used to monitor the performance of .NET applications running on a Windows system. They provide real-time information about various aspects of the application, such as CPU usage, memory usage, garbage collection, and exceptions.

By monitoring these performance counters, developers and system administrators can identify performance bottlenecks, diagnose issues, and optimize the performance of .NET applications. For example, if an application is experiencing high memory usage, the performance counters can help identify which parts of the application are consuming the most memory, and optimize those parts to reduce memory usage.

Performance counters can be accessed through the Windows Performance Monitor tool, or programmatically through the .NET Framework's System.Diagnostics namespace. The .NET Framework provides a number of built-in performance counters, and developers can also create custom performance counters to monitor application-specific metrics.
