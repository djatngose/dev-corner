# The Stopwatch Class
The Stopwatch class provides a convenient mechanism for measuring execution times. Stopwatch uses the highest-resolution mechanism that the OS and hardware provide, which is typically less than a microsecond. (In contrast, DateTime.Now and Environment.TickCount have a resolution of about 15 ms.)
To use Stopwatch, call StartNew—this instantiates a Stopwatch and starts it ticking. (Alternatively, you can instantiate it manually and then call Start.) The Elapsed property returns the elapsed interval as a TimeSpan:
    Stopwatch s = Stopwatch.StartNew();
    System.IO.File.WriteAllText ("test.txt", new string ('*', 30000000));
    Console.WriteLine (s.Elapsed);       // 00:00:01.4322661
Stopwatch also exposes an ElapsedTicks property, which returns the number of elapsed “ticks” as a long. To convert from ticks to seconds, divide by StopWatch .Frequency. There’s also an ElapsedMilliseconds property, which is often the most convenient.
Calling Stop freezes Elapsed and ElapsedTicks. There’s no background activity incurred by a “running” Stopwatch, so calling Stop is optional.
