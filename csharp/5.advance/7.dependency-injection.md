# in .net core DI constructor, why we need to declare field with readonly modifier before inject to constructor?
Declaring the field with the readonly modifier is important for several reasons. First, it ensures that the field can only be initialized in the constructor. This prevents accidental reassignment of the reference, which could lead to unexpected behavior.

Second, declaring the field with the readonly modifier makes it clear to other developers that the field is intended to be read-only. This can help to prevent bugs and make the code more maintainable.

Finally, declaring the field with the readonly modifier can help to ensure thread safety. If multiple threads are accessing the same instance of a class, using a readonly field can ensure that the reference is not changed by one thread while another thread is still using it.

In short, declaring fields with the readonly modifier before injecting them in the constructor helps to ensure that the reference is immutable and cannot be changed after it has been initialized, which can prevent bugs, make the code more maintainable, and ensure thread safety.

`Example #1: `Missing readonly modifier on field that is assigned in the constructor

```csharp
public class MyService
{
    private MyDependency _dependency;

    public MyService(MyDependency dependency)
    {
        _dependency = dependency;
    }

    public void DoSomething()
    {
        // use _dependency
    }
}

```
In this example, the _dependency field is assigned in the constructor, but it does not have the readonly modifier. This means that the _dependency field can be reassigned to a different instance after the constructor has completed. This can cause unexpected behavior if the MyService instance is used by multiple threads, as one thread may see a different instance of _dependency than another thread.

# serviceProvider.CreateScope()
It creates a new scope in the dependency injection (DI) container. Scopes are used to define a boundary for object lifetime and visibility within the DI container.

When you resolve a service in a scope, the container returns the same instance of the service throughout that scope. When the scope is disposed of, any objects that were created during that scope's lifetime are also disposed of.

By creating a new scope using serviceProvider.CreateScope(), you can ensure that objects are created and disposed of within a specific boundary, which can help manage object lifetime and prevent memory leaks.
