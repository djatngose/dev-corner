# try Statements and Exceptions
A try statement specifies a code block subject to error-handling or cleanup code. The try block must be followed by one or more catch blocks and/or a finally block, or both. The catch block executes when an error is thrown in the try block. The finally block executes after execution leaves the try block (or, if present, the catch block) to perform cleanup code, regardless of whether an exception was thrown.

A catch block has access to an Exception object that contains information about the error. You use a catch block to either compensate for the error or rethrow the exception. You rethrow an exception if you merely want to log the problem or if you want to rethrow a new, higher-level exception type.

A finally block adds determinism to your program: the CLR endeavors to always execute it. It’s useful for cleanup tasks such as closing network connections.
```c#
try
{
  ... // exception may get thrown within execution of this block
}
catch (ExceptionA ex)
{
  ... // handle exception of type ExceptionA
}
catch (ExceptionB ex)
{
  ... // handle exception of type ExceptionB
}
finally
{
  ... // cleanup code
}
```
Because x is zero, the runtime throws a DivideByZeroException, and our program terminates. We can prevent this by catching the exception as follows:
```c#
try
{
  int y = Calc (0);
  Console.WriteLine (y);
}
catch (DivideByZeroException ex)
{
  Console.WriteLine ("x cannot be zero");
}
Console.WriteLine ("program completed");

int Calc (int x) => 10 / x;

// Here’s the output:

x cannot be zero
program completed
```
`NOTE`:
This is a simple example to illustrate exception handling. We could deal with this particular scenario better in practice by checking explicitly for the divisor being zero before calling Calc.

Checking for preventable errors is preferable to relying on `try/catch blocks because exceptions are relatively expensive to handle, taking hundreds of clock cycles or more`

T he reason why try/catch blocks are used with caution is that handling exceptions can be relatively expensive in terms of performance. When an exception occurs, the runtime needs to create an exception object, unwind the call stack, and search for a suitable catch block to handle the exception. This process can take hundreds of clock cycles or more, depending on the complexity of the application and the number of catch blocks that need to be searched.

Therefore, if exceptions are used too liberally, it can impact the performance of an application, particularly if the application generates a large number of exceptions. In addition, exceptions can also introduce complexity to an application, making it harder to reason about and maintain.

## When an exception is thrown within a try statement, the CLR performs a test:

Does the try statement have any compatible catch blocks?
  - If so, execution jumps to the compatible catch block, followed by the finally block (if present), and then execution continues normally.
  - If not, execution jumps directly to the finally block (if present), then the CLR looks up the call stack for other try blocks; if found, it repeats the test.

If no function in the call stack takes responsibility for the exception, the program terminates.

# The catch Clause
A catch clause specifies what type of exception to catch. This must either be System.Exception or a subclass of System.Exception.

Catching `System.Exception` catches all possible errors. This is useful in the following circumstances:

  - Your program can potentially recover regardless of the specific exception type.
  - You plan to rethrow the exception (perhaps after logging it).
  - Your error handler is the last resort, prior to termination of the program.

More typically, though, you catch specific exception types to avoid having to deal with circumstances for which your handler wasn’t designed (e.g., an OutOfMemory​Ex⁠ception).

You can handle multiple exception types with multiple catch clauses (again, this example could be written with explicit argument checking rather than exception handling):

```c#
class Test
{
  static void Main (string[] args)
  {
    try
    {
      byte b = byte.Parse (args[0]);
      Console.WriteLine (b);
    }
    catch (IndexOutOfRangeException)
    {
      Console.WriteLine ("Please provide at least one argument");
    }
    catch (FormatException)
    {
      Console.WriteLine ("That's not a number!");
    }
    catch (OverflowException)
    {
      Console.WriteLine ("You've given me more than a byte!");
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("general exception");
    }
  }
}
//OUTPUT
Please provide at least one argument

```
Only one catch clause executes for a given exception. If you want to include a safety net to catch more general exceptions (such as System.Exception), you must put the more-specific handlers first.

An exception can be caught without specifying a variable, if you don’t need to access its properties:
```c#
catch (OverflowException)   // no variable
{
  ...
}
```
Furthermore, you can omit both the variable and the type (meaning that all exceptions will be caught):
```c#
catch { ... }
```
# Exception filters
You can specify an exception filter in a catch clause by adding a when clause:
```c#
catch (WebException ex) when (ex.Status == WebExceptionStatus.Timeout)
{
  ...
}
```
If a WebException is thrown in this example, the Boolean expression following the when keyword is then evaluated. If the result is false, the catch block in question is ignored and any subsequent catch clauses are considered. With exception filters, it can be meaningful to catch the same exception type again:
```c#
catch (WebException ex) when (ex.Status == WebExceptionStatus.Timeout)
{ ... }
catch (WebException ex) when (ex.Status == WebExceptionStatus.SendFailure)
{ ... }
```
The Boolean expression in the when clause can be side-effecting, such as a method that logs the exception for diagnostic purposes.
# The finally Block
A finally block always executes—regardless of whether an exception is thrown and whether the try block runs to completion. You typically use finally blocks for cleanup code.

A finally block executes after any of the following:

  - A catch block finishes (or throws a new exception).
  - The try block finishes (or throws an exception for which there’s no catch block => no available in .net 7).
  - Control leaves the try block because of a jump statement (e.g., return or goto).

The only things that can defeat a finally block are an infinite loop or the process ending abruptly.

A finally block helps add determinism to a program. In the following example, the file that we open always gets closed, regardless of whether:
  - The try block finishes normally.
  - Execution returns early because the file is empty (EndOfStream).
  - An IOException is thrown while reading the file. => no available in .net 7
```c#
void ReadFile()
{
  StreamReader reader = null;    // In System.IO namespace
  try
  {
    reader = File.OpenText ("file.txt");
    if (reader.EndOfStream) return;
    Console.WriteLine (reader.ReadToEnd());
  }
  finally
  {
    if (reader != null) reader.Dispose();
  }
}
```
In this example, we closed the file by calling Dispose on the StreamReader. Calling Dispose on an object, within a finally block, is a standard convention and is supported explicitly in C# through the using statement.

# try and finally without cach
When an exception occurs in a method, the .NET runtime unwinds the call stack until it finds an exception handler that can handle the exception. If the exception is not handled anywhere in the call stack, the program will terminate.

In the case where there is no catch block, any exception thrown in the try block will propagate up the call stack until it reaches a catch block that can handle it. However, if there is no catch block at all, the exception will keep propagating until it reaches the top-level caller, and if it still isn't handled, the program will terminate.

Using a finally block without a catch block is not sufficient to handle an exception. The finally block will execute regardless of whether an exception was thrown, but it does not handle the exception. If an exception is thrown in the try block and there is no catch block to handle it, the finally block will still execute, but the program will terminate after the finally block has finished executing.
```c#
try
{
    var a = 10;
    var b = 0;
    int result = a / b;
}
finally
{
   // no executed
    Console.WriteLine("finnaly");
}

//OUTPUT
Unhandled exception. System.DivideByZeroException: Attempted to divide by zero.
   at Program.<Main>$(String[] args) in /Users/dat.ngo/working/development/src/develop/dotnet/ConsoleApp1/ConsoleApp1/Program.cs:line 28

```
# The using statement
Many classes encapsulate unmanaged resources, such as file handles, graphics handles, or database connections. These classes implement System.IDisposable, which defines a single parameterless method named Dispose to clean up these resources. The using statement provides an elegant syntax for calling Dispose on an IDisposable object within a finally block.

Thus,

using (StreamReader reader = File.OpenText ("file.txt"))
{
  ...
}
is precisely equivalent to the following:

{
  StreamReader reader = File.OpenText ("file.txt");
  try
  {
    ...
  }
  finally
  {
    if (reader != null)
      ((IDisposable)reader).Dispose();
  }
}
using declarations
If you omit the brackets and statement block following a using statement (C# 8+), it becomes a using declaration. The resource is then disposed when execution falls outside the enclosing statement block:

if (File.Exists ("file.txt"))
{
  using var reader = File.OpenText ("file.txt");  
  Console.WriteLine (reader.ReadLine());
  ...
}
In this case, reader will be disposed when execution falls outside the if statement block.
# throw expressions
throw can also appear as an expression in expression-bodied functions:

public string Foo() => throw new NotImplementedException();
A throw expression can also appear in a ternary conditional expression:

string ProperCase (string value) =>
  value == null ? throw new ArgumentException ("value") :
  value == "" ? "" :
  char.ToUpper (value[0]) + value.Substring (1);

# Rethrowing an exception
You can capture and rethrow an exception as follows:

try {  ...  }
catch (Exception ex)
{
  // Log error
  ...
  throw;          // Rethrow same exception
}
`Note`: If we replaced throw with `throw ex`, the example would still work, but the StackTrace property of the newly propagated exception would no longer reflect the original error.
Rethrowing in this manner lets you log an error without swallowing it. It also lets you back out of handling an exception should circumstances turn out to be beyond what you expected. The other common scenario is to rethrow a more specific exception type:

try
{
  ... // Parse a DateTime from XML element data
}
catch (FormatException ex)
{
  throw new XmlException ("Invalid DateTime", ex);
}
Notice that when we constructed XmlException, we passed in the original exception, ex, as the second argument. This argument populates the InnerException property of the new exception and aids debugging. Nearly all types of exception offer a similar constructor.

`Rethrowing a less-specific exception is something you might do when crossing a trust boundary, so as not to leak technical information to potential hackers.`
# Throw and re-throw
The `throw` statement throws the current exception without changing its stack trace. This means that the exception is thrown from the same location in the code where it occurred.
the `throw ex` statement throws the current exception and resets its stack trace to the point where the exception is rethrown. This means that the original stack trace is lost, and the new stack trace starts at the throw ex statement.
```c#

//throw an rethrow
try
{
    ThrowException();
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Caught exception with message: {ex.Message} {ex.StackTrace}");
}

try
{
    ThrowExceptionEx();
}
catch (Exception ex)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"Caught exception with message: {ex.Message} {ex.StackTrace}");
}

Console.ReadLine();

 void ThrowException()
{
    try
    {
        var a = 10;
        var b = 0;
        // no found this error in this line
        int result = a / b;
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        // statement throws the current exception and resets its stack trace to the point where the exception is rethrown.
        // This means that the original stack trace is lost, and the new stack trace starts at the throw ex statement
        throw ex;  
    }
}

 void ThrowExceptionEx()
{
    try
    {
        var a = 10;
        var b = 0;
        var e = 0;
        // stack trace will show the original error here if use throw, The throw statement throws the current exception without changing its stack trace.
        // This means that the exception is thrown from the same location in the code where it occurred.
        int result = a / b;  
        var c = 1;
        var d = 2;
    }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
        throw;
    }
}
```
# what 's real life scenarios to use either throw or throw ex?
Transforming or wrapping exceptions: Sometimes, you may want to transform an exception into a different type, or wrap it in a custom exception with additional information. In such cases, you can catch the original exception, perform the transformation/wrapping, and then re-throw it using throw ex.
```c#
try {
    // Some code that throws InvalidOperationException
}
catch (InvalidOperationException ex) {
    // Wrap the exception in a custom exception with additional info
    throw new CustomException("An error occurred", ex);
}
```
Hiding sensitive information: If an exception contains sensitive information that you don't want to reveal to the user, you can catch the exception, log it with a generic message, and then throw a new exception without the sensitive information using throw ex.
```c#
try {
    // Some code that throws a custom exception with sensitive info
}
catch (CustomException ex) {
    // Log the exception with a generic message
    logger.LogError("An error occurred");
    
    // Throw a new exception without the sensitive info
    throw new CustomException("An error occurred");
}
```
It's important to note that in both of these scenarios, throw ex should only be used if you're absolutely sure that it won't cause any issues with the stack trace or other debugging information. In general, it's recommended to use throw whenever possible, and only use throw ex in specific, well-defined scenarios.

# Key Properties of System.Exception
The most important properties of System.Exception are the following:

`StackTrace`
A string representing all the methods that are called from the origin of the exception to the catch block.
provides information about the call stack at the time the exception was thrown. The StackTrace property is a string that contains the names of the methods on the call stack, as well as the file name and line number where each method was called. This information can be very useful for debugging and diagnosing problems in your code.
```c#
public class Example
{
    public void DoSomething()
    {
        try
        {
            // Some code that might throw an exception
            throw new Exception("Oops! Something went wrong.");
        }
        catch (Exception ex)
        {
            // Log the exception details
            Console.WriteLine($"Exception Message: {ex.Message}");
            Console.WriteLine($"StackTrace: {ex.StackTrace}");
        }
    }
}
// Call the DoSomething method
var example = new Example();
example.DoSomething();
```
In this example, the DoSomething method throws an exception inside the try block. The catch block catches the exception and logs its details, including the stack trace. The stack trace is printed to the console using the ex.StackTrace property.

The output of the code might look something like this:

```c#
Exception Message: Oops! Something went wrong.
StackTrace:    at Example.DoSomething() in C:\example.cs:line 9
   at Program.Main() in C:\program.cs:line 12
```
The stack trace shows the sequence of method calls that led up to the exception being thrown. In this case, the DoSomething method was called from the Main method, and the exception was thrown on line 9 of the DoSomething method. The stack trace shows the file path and line number where each method was called, which can be useful for debugging and troubleshooting.

`Message`
A string with a description of the error.
`InnerException`
The inner exception (if any) that caused the outer exception. This, itself, can have another InnerException.
InnerException is used to provide information about the underlying cause of the current exception. When an exception occurs, it is possible for that exception to be caused by another exception. The InnerException property allows you to access the exception that caused the current exception. This is useful when you need to debug an issue and you want to know the root cause of the problem.

Suppose we have a method that makes a network request and we want to handle any exceptions that might occur. We might use the following code:
```c#
public void MakeNetworkRequest()
{
    try
    {
        // make the network request
    }
    catch (WebException ex)
    {
        throw new MyException("An error occurred while making the network request", ex);
    }
}
In this example, we catch a WebException that might be thrown if there is a problem with the network request. We wrap it in our custom MyException and pass it as the innerException parameter. This allows us to provide a more specific error message to the caller while still preserving the original exception information.

In both of these examples, we use InnerException to provide additional context about an error while preserving the original exception's information. This can be helpful in debugging and troubleshooting issues in our application.
```
NOTE
All exceptions in C# are runtime exceptions—there is no equivalent to Java’s compile-time checked exceptions.

# Common Exception Types
The following exception types are used widely throughout the CLR and .NET libraries. You can throw these yourself or use them as base classes for deriving custom exception types:

`System.ArgumentException`
Thrown when a function is called with a bogus argument. This generally indicates a program bug.
`System.ArgumentNullException`
Subclass of ArgumentException that’s thrown when a function argument is (unexpectedly) null.
`System.ArgumentOutOfRangeException`
Subclass of ArgumentException that’s thrown when a (usually numeric) argument is too big or too small. For example, this is thrown when passing a negative number into a function that accepts only positive values.
`System.InvalidOperationException`
Thrown when the state of an object is unsuitable for a method to successfully execute, regardless of any particular argument values. Examples include reading an unopened file or getting the next element from an enumerator for which the underlying list has been modified partway through the iteration.
`System.NotSupportedException`
Thrown to indicate that a particular functionality is not supported. A good example is calling the Add method on a collection for which IsReadOnly returns true.
`System.NotImplementedException`
Thrown to indicate that a function has not yet been implemented.
`System.ObjectDisposedException`
Thrown when the object upon which the function is called has been disposed.
`KeyNotFoundException`: This exception is thrown when a key is not found in a dictionary.
`FormatException`: This exception is thrown when a string cannot be parsed into the expected format.
`ObjectDisposedException`: This exception is thrown when an operation is performed on a disposed object.
`TimeoutException`: This exception is thrown when an operation times out.
`NotSupportedException`: This exception is thrown when an operation is not supported.

Another commonly encountered exception type is NullReferenceException. The CLR throws this exception when you attempt to access a member of an object whose value is null (indicating a bug in your code). You can throw a NullReferenceException directly (for testing purposes) as follows:

throw null;

# The TryXXX Method Pattern
When writing a method, you have a choice, when something goes wrong, to return some kind of failure code or throw an exception. In general, you throw an exception when the error is outside the normal workflow—or if you expect that the immediate caller won’t be able to cope with it. Occasionally, though, it can be best to offer both choices to the consumer. An example of this is the int type, which defines two versions of its Parse method:

public int Parse     (string input);
public bool TryParse (string input, out int returnValue);
If parsing fails, Parse throws an exception; TryParse returns false.

You can implement this pattern by having the XXX method call the TryXXX method as follows:

public return-type XXX (input-type input)
{
  return-type returnValue;
  if (!TryXXX (input, out returnValue))
    throw new YYYException (...)
  return returnValue;
}

# Alternatives to Exceptions
As with int.TryParse, a function can communicate failure by sending an error code back to the calling function via a return type or parameter. Although this can work with simple and predictable failures, it becomes clumsy when extended to all errors, polluting method signatures and creating unnecessary complexity and clutter. It also cannot generalize to functions that are not methods, such as operators (e.g., the division operator) or properties. An alternative is to place the error in a common place where all functions in the call stack can see it (e.g., a static method that stores the current error per thread). This, though, requires each function to participate in an error-propagation pattern, which is cumbersome and, ironically, itself error prone.
