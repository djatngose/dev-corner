# Attributes
You’re already familiar with the notion of attributing code elements of a program with modifiers, such as virtual or ref. These constructs are built into the language. Attributes are an extensible mechanism for adding custom information to code elements (assemblies, types, members, return values, parameters, and generic type parameters). This extensibility is useful for services that integrate deeply into the type system, without requiring special keywords or constructs in the C# language.

A good scenario for attributes is serialization—the process of converting arbitrary objects to and from a particular format for storage or transmission. In this scenario, an attribute on a field can specify the translation between C#’s representation of the field and the format’s representation of the field.

# Attribute Classes
An attribute is defined by a class that inherits (directly or indirectly) from the abstract class System.Attribute. To attach an attribute to a code element, specify the attribute’s type name in square brackets, before the code element. For example, the following attaches the ObsoleteAttribute to the Foo class:

[ObsoleteAttribute]
public class Foo {...}
This particular attribute is recognized by the compiler and will cause compiler warnings if a type or member marked as obsolete is referenced. By convention, all attribute types end in the word Attribute. C# recognizes this and allows you to omit the suffix when attaching an attribute:

[Obsolete]
public class Foo {...}
ObsoleteAttribute is a type declared in the System namespace as follows (simplified for brevity):

public sealed class ObsoleteAttribute : Attribute {...}

# Named and Positional Attribute Parameters
Attributes can have parameters. In the following example, we apply XmlTypeAttribute to a class. This attribute instructs the XML serializer (in System.Xml.Serialization) as to how an object is represented in XML and accepts several attribute parameters. The following attribute maps the CustomerEntity class to an XML element named Customer, which belongs to the http://oreilly.com namespace:

[XmlType ("Customer", Namespace="http://oreilly.com")]
public class CustomerEntity { ... }
Attribute parameters fall into one of two categories: positional or named. In the preceding example, the first argument is a positional parameter; the second is a named parameter. Positional parameters correspond to parameters of the attribute type’s public constructors. Named parameters correspond to public fields or public properties on the attribute type.

When specifying an attribute, you must include positional parameters that correspond to one of the attribute’s constructors. Named parameters are optional.

# Applying Attributes to Assemblies and Backing Fields
Implicitly, the target of an attribute is the code element it immediately precedes, which is typically a type or type member. You can also attach attributes, however, to an assembly. This requires that you explicitly specify the attribute’s target. Here is how you can use the AssemblyFileVersion attribute to attach a version to the assembly:

[assembly: AssemblyFileVersion ("1.2.3.4")]
From C# 7.3, you can use the field: prefix to apply an attribute to the backing fields of an automatic property. This can be useful in controlling serialization:

[field:NonSerialized]
public int MyProperty { get; set; }

# Applying Attributes to Lambda Expressions (C# 10)
From C# 10, you can apply attributes to the method, parameters, and return value of a lambda expression:

Action<int> a = [Description ("Method")]
                [return: Description ("Return value")]
                ([Description ("Parameter")]int x) => Console.Write (x);

These attributes are applied to the compiler-generated method to which the delegate points. In Chapter 18, we’ll describe how to reflect over attributes in code. For now, here’s the extra code you need to resolve that indirection:

var methodAtt = a.GetMethodInfo().GetCustomAttributes();
var paramAtt = a.GetMethodInfo().GetParameters()[0].GetCustomAttributes();
var returnAtt = a.GetMethodInfo().ReturnParameter.GetCustomAttributes();
To avoid syntactical ambiguity when applying attributes to a parameter on a lambda expression, parentheses are always required. Attributes are not permitted on expression-tree lambdas.

# Specifying Multiple Attributes
You can specify multiple attributes for a single code element. You can list each attribute either within the same pair of square brackets (separated by a comma) or in separate pairs of square brackets (or a combination of the two). The following three examples are semantically identical:

[Serializable, Obsolete, CLSCompliant(false)]
public class Bar {...}

[Serializable] [Obsolete] [CLSCompliant(false)]
public class Bar {...}

[Serializable, Obsolete]
[CLSCompliant(false)]
public class Bar {...}

# Caller Info Attributes
You can tag optional parameters with one of three caller info attributes, which instruct the compiler to feed information obtained from the caller’s source code into the parameter’s default value:

[CallerMemberName] applies the caller’s member name.

[CallerFilePath] applies the path to the caller’s source code file.

[CallerLineNumber] applies the line number in the caller’s source code file.

The Foo method in the following program demonstrates all three:

using System;
using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;

class Program
{
  static void Main() => Foo();

  static void Foo (
    [CallerMemberName] string memberName = null,
    [CallerFilePath] string filePath = null,
    [CallerLineNumber] int lineNumber = 0)
  {
    Console.WriteLine (memberName);
    Console.WriteLine (filePath);
    Console.WriteLine (lineNumber);
  }
}
Assuming that our program resides in c:\source\test\Program.cs, the output would be:

Main
c:\source\test\Program.cs

# when we use serialization attribute in c#?

In C#, serialization is the process of converting an object into a format that can be easily stored or transmitted. This is useful when you need to save an object's state to a file or database, or when you need to send an object over a network.

Serialization attributes in C# are used to control how an object is serialized. There are several serialization attributes available in C#, including:

[Serializable]: This attribute is used to mark a class as serializable. When this attribute is applied to a class, it tells the .NET runtime that instances of this class can be serialized.

[NonSerialized]: This attribute is used to mark a field in a serializable class as non-serializable. When this attribute is applied to a field, it tells the .NET runtime not to include that field when the object is serialized.

[DataMember]: This attribute is used to mark a field or property in a class as serializable. When this attribute is applied to a field or property, it tells the .NET runtime to include that field or property when the object is serialized.

[DataContract]: This attribute is used to mark a class as serializable in a specific data contract format, such as XML or JSON. When this attribute is applied to a class, it tells the .NET runtime that instances of this class can be serialized in the specified data contract format.

The `Serializer` class is used to convert an object graph to a stream of bytes (serialization) or to rebuild an object graph from a stream of bytes (deserialization). When you use the Serializer class, you can specify various settings, such as the type of serializer to use (binary, XML, JSON), the encoding to use, and the data contract to apply.

If you don't use the `Serializer` class, you would have to manually convert the object graph to XML or binary format and vice versa. This would require more effort and could be error-prone. Additionally, you would have to manually handle complex data types, such as collections, and ensure that they are serialized and deserialized correctly.

The `Serializer` class provides a more efficient and flexible way to perform serialization and deserialization, and it also allows you to easily switch between different serialization formats.

Example 1: Using Serializer Class

csharp
Copy code
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Xml.Serialization;

public class Person
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Person person = new Person() { FirstName = "John", LastName = "Doe" };
        XmlSerializer serializer = new XmlSerializer(typeof(Person));
        
        using (TextWriter writer = new StreamWriter(@"C:\Temp\person.xml"))
        {
            serializer.Serialize(writer, person);
        }
        
        Console.WriteLine("Person object serialized to XML.");
    }
}
In this example, we are using the XmlSerializer class to serialize a Person object to XML. We create an instance of the XmlSerializer class, and then use its Serialize method to serialize the Person object to a file.

Example 2: Not Using Serializer Class

csharp
Copy code
using System;
using System.IO;
using System.Xml;

public class Person
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
}

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Person person = new Person() { FirstName = "John", LastName = "Doe" };
        
        using (XmlWriter writer = XmlWriter.Create(@"C:\Temp\person.xml"))
        {
            writer.WriteStartElement("Person");
            writer.WriteElementString("FirstName", person.FirstName);
            writer.WriteElementString("LastName", person.LastName);
            writer.WriteEndElement();
        }
        
        Console.WriteLine("Person object serialized to XML.");
    }
}
In this example, we are not using the XmlSerializer class, but instead are manually writing the XML to a file using the XmlWriter class. We create an instance of the XmlWriter class, and then use its methods to write the Person object's properties to an XML file.

The main difference between these examples is that the XmlSerializer class automates much of the XML serialization process, whereas the second example requires more manual coding to generate the XML. The XmlSerializer class can also handle more complex objects with nested properties and collections, whereas the second example would require more complex code to handle these scenarios.

As with standard optional parameters, the substitution is done at the calling site. Hence, our Main method is syntactic sugar for this:

static void Main() => Foo ("Main", @"c:\source\test\Program.cs", 6);
Caller info attributes are useful for logging—and for implementing patterns such as firing a single change notification event whenever any property on an object changes. In fact, there’s a standard interface for this in the System.ComponentModel namespace, called INotifyPropertyChanged:

public interface INotifyPropertyChanged
{
  event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged;
}

public delegate void PropertyChangedEventHandler
  (object sender, PropertyChangedEventArgs e);

public class PropertyChangedEventArgs : EventArgs
{
  public PropertyChangedEventArgs (string propertyName);
  public virtual string PropertyName { get; }
}
Notice that PropertyChangedEventArgs requires the name of the property that changed. By applying the [CallerMemberName] attribute, however, we can implement this interface and invoke the event without ever specifying property names:

public class Foo : INotifyPropertyChanged
{
  public event PropertyChangedEventHandler PropertyChanged = delegate { };

  void RaisePropertyChanged ([CallerMemberName] string propertyName = null)
    => PropertyChanged (this, new PropertyChangedEventArgs (propertyName));

  string customerName;
  public string CustomerName
  {  
    get => customerName;
    set  
    {  
      if (value == customerName) return;
      customerName = value;
      RaisePropertyChanged();
      // The compiler converts the above line to:
      // RaisePropertyChanged ("CustomerName");
    } 
  }
}

Sure! Here is an example of how to use the CallerMemberName attribute to get the name of the calling method:

csharp
Copy code
using System.Runtime.CompilerServices;

class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        Log("This is a log message");
    }

    static void Log(string message, [CallerMemberName] string methodName = "")
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"[{methodName}] {message}");
    }
}
In this example, the Log method takes a message parameter and an optional methodName parameter, which is annotated with the CallerMemberName attribute. When the Log method is called, the methodName parameter is automatically populated with the name of the calling method. In this case, since we're calling the Log method from the Main method, the output will be:

```c#
[Main] This is a log message
```

CallerArgumentExpression (C# 10)
A method parameter to which you apply the [CallerArgumentExpression] attribute captures an argument expression from the call site:


```c#
Print (Math.PI * 2);

void Print (double number,
    [CallerArgumentExpression("number")] string expr = null)
    => Console.WriteLine ($"{expr} {number}");

// Output: Math.PI * 2  6,283185307179586

```

The compiler feeds in the calling expression’s source code literally, including comments:

Print (Math.PI /*(π)*/ * 2);

// Output:  Math.PI /*(π)*/ * 2

The main application for this feature is when writing validation and assertion libraries. In the following example, an exception is thrown, whose message includes the text “2 + 2 == 5”. This aids in debugging:

Assert (2 + 2 == 5);

void Assert (bool condition,
            [CallerArgumentExpression ("condition")] string message = null)
{
  if (!condition) throw new Exception ("Assertion failed: " + message);
}

Another example is the static ThrowIfNull method on the ArgumentNullException class. This method was introduced in .NET 6 and is defined as follows:

public static void ThrowIfNull (object argument,
  [CallerArgumentExpression("argument")] string paramName = null)
{
  if (argument == null)
    throw new ArgumentNullException (paramName);
}
It is used as follows:

void Print (string message)
{
  ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull (message); 
  ...
}
You can use [CallerArgumentExpression] multiple times, to capture multiple argument expressions.
