# Patterns

we demonstrated how to use the is operator to test whether a reference conversion will succeed:
```c#
if (obj is string)
  Console.WriteLine (((string)obj).Length);
```
Or, more concisely:
```c#
if (obj is string s)
  Console.WriteLine (s.Length);
```
This employs one kind of pattern called a type pattern. The is operator also supports other patterns that were introduced in recent versions of C#, such as the property pattern:
```c#
if (obj is string { Length:4 })
  Console.WriteLine ("A string with 4 characters");
```

Patterns are supported in the following contexts:
  - After the is operator (variable is pattern)
  - In switch statements
  - In switch expressions

# var Pattern
The var pattern is a variation of the type pattern whereby you replace the type name with the var keyword. The conversion always succeeds, so its purpose is merely to let you reuse the variable that follows:
```c#
bool IsJanetOrJohn (string name) => 
  name.ToUpper() is var upper && (upper == "JANET" || upper == "JOHN");
```
This is equivalent to:
```c#
bool IsJanetOrJohn (string name)
{
  string upper = name.ToUpper();
  return upper == "JANET" || upper == "JOHN";
}
```
The ability to introduce and reuse an intermediate variable (upper, in this case) in an expression-bodied method is convenient. Unfortunately, it tends to be useful only when the method in question has a bool return type.

# Constant Pattern
The constant pattern lets you match directly to a constant, and is useful when working with the object type:
```c#
void Foo (object obj) 
{
  if (obj is 3) ...
}
```
This expression in boldface is equivalent to the following:
```c#
obj is int && (int)obj == 3
```
(Being a static operator, C# won’t let you use == to compare an object directly to a constant, because the compiler needs to know the types in advance.)

On its own, this pattern is only marginally useful in that there’s a reasonable alternative:

if (3.Equals (obj)) ...
As we’ll see soon, the constant pattern can become more useful with pattern combinators.

# Relational Patterns
From C# 9, you can use the <, >, <=, and >= operators in patterns:

if (x is > 100) Console.WriteLine ("x is greater than 100");
This becomes meaningfully useful in a switch:

string GetWeightCategory (decimal bmi) => bmi switch
{
  < 18.5m => "underweight",
  < 25m => "normal",
  < 30m => "overweight",
  _ => "obese"
};

Note:
The relational pattern also works when the variable has a compile-time type of object, but you have to be extremely careful with your use of numeric constants. In the following example, the last line prints False because we are attempting to match a decimal value to an integer literal:
```c#
object obj = 2m;                  // obj is decimal
Console.WriteLine (obj is < 3m);  // True
Console.WriteLine (obj is < 3);   // False
```

# Pattern Combinators
From C# 9, you can use the and, or, and not keywords to combine patterns:

bool IsJanetOrJohn (string name) => name.ToUpper() is "JANET" or "JOHN";

bool IsVowel (char c) => c is 'a' or 'e' or 'i' or 'o' or 'u';

bool Between1And9 (int n) => n is >= 1 and <= 9;

bool IsLetter (char c) => c is >= 'a' and <= 'z'
                            or >= 'A' and <= 'Z';
As with the && and || operators, and has higher precedence than or. You can override this with parentheses.

A nice trick is to combine the not combinator with the type pattern to test whether an object is (not) a type:

if (obj is not string) ...
This looks nicer than:

if (!(obj is string)) ...

# Tuple and Positional Patterns
The tuple pattern (introduced in C# 8) matches tuples:

var p = (2, 3);
Console.WriteLine (p is (2, 3));   // True
You can use this to switch on multiple values:

int AverageCelsiusTemperature (Season season, bool daytime) =>
  (season, daytime) switch
  {
    (Season.Spring, true) => 20,
    (Season.Spring, false) => 16,
    (Season.Summer, true) => 27,
    (Season.Summer, false) => 22,
    (Season.Fall, true) => 18,
    (Season.Fall, false) => 12,
    (Season.Winter, true) => 10,
    (Season.Winter, false) => -2,
    _ => throw new Exception ("Unexpected combination")
};

enum Season { Spring, Summer, Fall, Winter };
The tuple pattern can be considered a special case of the positional pattern (C# 8+), which matches any type that exposes a Deconstruct method (see “Deconstructors”). In the following example, we leverage the Point record’s compiler-generated deconstructor:

var p = new Point (2, 2);
Console.WriteLine (p is (2, 2));  // True

record Point (int X, int Y);      // Has compiler-generated deconstructor
You can deconstruct as you match, using the following syntax:

Console.WriteLine (p is (var x, var y) && x == y);   // True
Here’s a switch expression that combines a type pattern with a positional pattern:

string Print (object obj) => obj switch 
{
  Point (0, 0)                      => "Empty point",
  Point (var x, var y) when x == y  => "Diagonal"
  ...
};

# Property Patterns
A property pattern (C# 8+) matches on one or more of an object’s property values. We gave a simple example previously in the context of the is operator:

if (obj is string { Length:4 }) ...
However, this doesn’t save much over the following:

if (obj is string s && s.Length == 4) ...
With switch statements and expressions, property patterns are more useful. Consider the System.Uri class, which represents a URI. It has properties that include Scheme, Host, Port, and IsLoopback. In writing a firewall, we could decide whether to allow or block a URI by employing a switch expression that uses property patterns:

bool ShouldAllow (Uri uri) => uri switch
{
  { Scheme: "http",  Port: 80  } => true,
  { Scheme: "https", Port: 443 } => true,
  { Scheme: "ftp",   Port: 21  } => true,
  { IsLoopback: true           } => true,
  _ => false
};
You can nest properties, making the following clause legal:

  { Scheme: { Length: 4 }, Port: 80 } => true,
which, from C# 10, can be simplified to:

  { Scheme.Length: 4, Port: 80 } => true,
You can use other patterns inside property patterns, including the relational pattern:

  { Host: { Length: < 1000 }, Port: > 0 } => true,
More elaborate conditions can be expressed with a when clause:

  { Scheme: "http" } when string.IsNullOrWhiteSpace (uri.Query) => true,
You can also combine the property pattern with the type pattern:

bool ShouldAllow (object uri) => uri switch
{
  Uri { Scheme: "http",  Port: 80  } => true,
  Uri { Scheme: "https", Port: 443 } => true,
  ...
As you might expect with type patterns, you can introduce a variable at the end of a clause and then consume that variable:

  Uri { Scheme: "http", Port: 80 } httpUri => httpUri.Host.Length < 1000,
You can also use that variable in a when clause:

  Uri { Scheme: "http", Port: 80 } httpUri 
                                   when httpUri.Host.Length < 1000 => true,
A somewhat bizarre twist with property patterns is that you can also introduce variables at the property level:

  { Scheme: "http", Port: 80, Host: string host } => host.Length < 1000,
Implicit typing is permitted, so you can substitute string with var. Here’s a complete example:

bool ShouldAllow (Uri uri) => uri switch
{
  { Scheme: "http",  Port: 80, Host: var host } => host.Length < 1000,
  { Scheme: "https", Port: 443                } => true,
  { Scheme: "ftp",   Port: 21                 } => true,
  { IsLoopback: true                          } => true,
  _ => false
};
It’s difficult to invent examples for which this saves more than a few characters. In our case, the alternative is actually shorter:

  { Scheme: "http", Port: 80 } => uri.Host.Length < 1000 => ...
Or:

  { Scheme: "http", Port: 80, Host: { Length: < 1000 } } => ...
