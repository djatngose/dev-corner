# what is GetEnumerator in .net?
GetEnumerator() is a method in .NET that returns an IEnumerator object that can be used to iterate through a collection of objects.

In C#, you can use foreach to iterate over an object that implements IEnumerable or IEnumerable<T> interfaces. When you use foreach on a collection, it calls the GetEnumerator() method to obtain an enumerator for the collection.

The GetEnumerator() method returns an object that implements the IEnumerator interface, which provides methods to move to the next item in the collection and retrieve the current item. The IEnumerator interface defines two methods: MoveNext() and Reset(), and a property called Current.
Here is an example of using GetEnumerator() to iterate over an array of integers:

```c#
int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };

IEnumerator enumerator = numbers.GetEnumerator();

while (enumerator.MoveNext())
{
    Console.WriteLine(enumerator.Current);
}
```
# does numbers.GetEnumerator(); load all data into this?
calling numbers.GetEnumerator() does not load all data into memory. It returns an instance of an enumerator object that allows iterating over the elements of the collection one by one. Each time you call the MoveNext() method on the enumerator object, it retrieves the next element of the collection and advances the enumerator to the next position. This allows you to iterate over large collections without loading all the data into memory at once.

# Enumeration
An enumerator is a read-only, forward-only cursor over a sequence of values. C# treats a type as an enumerator if it does any of the following:

  - Has a public parameterless method named MoveNext and property called Current
  - Implements System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerator<T>
  - Implements System.Collections.IEnumerator

The foreach statement iterates over an enumerable object. An enumerable object is the logical representation of a sequence. It is not itself a cursor, but an object that produces cursors over itself. C# treats a type as enumerable if it does any of the following (the check is performed in this order):

  - Has a public parameterless method named GetEnumerator that returns an enumerator
  - Implements System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<T>
  - Implements System.Collections.IEnumerable
  - (From C# 9) Can bind to an extension method named GetEnumerator that returns an enumerator (see “Extension Methods”)

The enumeration pattern is as follows:
```c#
class Enumerator   // Typically implements IEnumerator or IEnumerator<T>
{
  public IteratorVariableType Current { get {...} }
  public bool MoveNext() {...}
}

class Enumerable   // Typically implements IEnumerable or IEnumerable<T>
{
  public Enumerator GetEnumerator() {...}
}
```
Here is the high-level way of iterating through the characters in the word beer using a foreach statement:
```c#
foreach (char c in "beer")
  Console.WriteLine (c);
```

Here is the low-level way of iterating through the characters in beer without using a foreach statement:
```c#
using (var enumerator = "beer".GetEnumerator())
  while (enumerator.MoveNext())
  {
    var element = enumerator.Current;
    Console.WriteLine (element);
  }
```
If the enumerator implements IDisposable, the foreach statement also acts as a using statement, implicitly disposing the enumerator object.

# Collection Initializers
You can instantiate and populate an enumerable object in a single step:

using System.Collections.Generic;
...

List<int> list = new List<int> {1, 2, 3};
The compiler translates this to the following:

using System.Collections.Generic;
...

List<int> list = new List<int>();
list.Add (1);
list.Add (2);
list.Add (3);
This requires that the enumerable object implements the System.Collections.IEnumerable interface, and that it has an Add method that has the appropriate number of parameters for the call. You can similarly initialize dictionaries (see “Dictionaries”) as follows:

var dict = new Dictionary<int, string>()
{
  { 5, "five" },
  { 10, "ten" }
};
Or, more succinctly:

var dict = new Dictionary<int, string>()
{
  [3] = "three",
  [10] = "ten"
};
The latter is valid not only with dictionaries but with any type for which an indexer exists.

# Iterators
Whereas a foreach statement is a consumer of an enumerator, an iterator is a producer of an enumerator. In this example, we use an iterator to return a sequence of Fibonacci numbers (where each number is the sum of the previous two):
```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

foreach (int fib in Fibs(6))
  Console.Write (fib + "  ");
}

IEnumerable<int> Fibs (int fibCount)
{
  for (int i = 0, prevFib = 1, curFib = 1; i < fibCount; i++)
  {
    yield return prevFib;
    int newFib = prevFib+curFib;
    prevFib = curFib;
    curFib = newFib;
  }
}

OUTPUT: 1  1  2  3  5  8
```
Whereas a return statement expresses, `Here’s the value you asked me to return from this method,` a yield return statement expresses, `Here’s the next element you asked me to yield from this enumerator.` On each yield statement, control is returned to the caller, but the callee’s state is maintained so that the method can continue executing as soon as the caller enumerates the next element. The lifetime of this state is bound to the enumerator such that the state can be released when the caller has finished enumerating.

# What's the benefits using Enumerator.GetEnumerator() in real life scenarios?
`Custom iteration`: When you use GetEnumerator() to create an iterator method, you can define your own custom iteration logic. This allows you to iterate over complex data structures in a way that makes sense for your application. For example, if you have a hierarchical data structure, you can define an iterator that traverses the structure in a specific order.
`Encapsulation`: When you use GetEnumerator() to create an iterator method, you can encapsulate the iteration logic within the method. This can make your code cleaner and more modular, as you don't have to worry about the details of iterating over the data set outside of the method.
`perform the operation asynchronously`
`Parsing complex data structures`: When parsing complex data structures like XML or JSON, it's often useful to use Enumerator.GetEnumerator() to navigate through the nested elements. 
# Iterator Semantics
An iterator is a method, property, or indexer that contains one or more yield statements. An iterator must return one of the following four interfaces (otherwise, the compiler will generate an error):

// Enumerable interfaces
System.Collections.IEnumerable
System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable<T>

// Enumerator interfaces
System.Collections.IEnumerator
System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerator<T>
An iterator has different semantics, depending on whether it returns an enumerable interface or an enumerator interface. We describe this in Chapter 7.

Multiple yield statements are permitted:

foreach (string s in Foo())
  Console.WriteLine(s);         // Prints "One","Two","Three"

IEnumerable<string> Foo()
{
  yield return "One";
  yield return "Two";
  yield return "Three";
}

# yield break
A return statement is illegal in an iterator block; instead you must use the yield break statement to indicate that the iterator block should exit early, without returning more elements. We can modify Foo as follows to demonstrate:

IEnumerable<string> Foo (bool breakEarly)
{
  yield return "One";
  yield return "Two";

  if (breakEarly)
    yield break;

  yield return "Three";
}

yield can be useful when working with external APIs and data processing pipelines:
```c#
public static IEnumerable<string> GetFileLines(string filePath)
{
    using (var reader = new StreamReader(filePath))
    {
        string line;
        while ((line = reader.ReadLine()) != null)
        {
            yield return line;
        }
    }
}

public static void ProcessFile(string filePath)
{
    var lines = GetFileLines(filePath);
    var filteredLines = lines.Where(line => line.StartsWith("important"));

    foreach (var line in filteredLines)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(line);
    }
}

```
`Scenarios where using yield can be useful:`
`Reading and processing large data files`: When reading a large data file, yield can be used to read the data one chunk at a time, rather than loading the entire file into memory at once. This can help to reduce memory usage and improve performance.
`Generating test data`: When testing an application, you may need to generate a large amount of test data. Using yield to generate the data can save memory and improve performance, since you can generate the data on the fly as it is needed.

`Parsing large files`: When reading large files, it may be impractical to read the entire file into memory at once. Using yield to parse the file can allow you to process the data in small chunks, making it more memory-efficient.
The method uses a stack to keep track of the current element hierarchy as it reads each line of the file. It calculates the indentation level of each line and uses it to determine the parent element of the current element.

The yield return statement is used to lazily generate each Element object as it is parsed, allowing the caller to process the parsed elements one at a time without having to wait for the entire file to be parsed.
```c#
public static IEnumerable<Element> Parse(string input)
{
    var lines = input.Split(Environment.NewLine);
    var stack = new Stack<Element>();
    stack.Push(new Element { Name = "root", Children = new List<Element>() });

    foreach (var line in lines)
    {
        var indent = line.Length - line.TrimStart().Length;
        var elementName = line.Trim();
        var element = new Element { Name = elementName, Children = new List<Element>() };

        while (stack.Count > indent + 1)
        {
            stack.Pop();
        }

        var parent = stack.Peek();
        parent.Children.Add(element);
        stack.Push(element);

        yield return element;
    }

    while (stack.Count > 1)
    {
        stack.Pop();
    }

    yield return stack.Pop();
}


var input = "root\n  child1\n    grandchild1\n    grandchild2\n  child2\n    grandchild3\n      greatgrandchild1\n";
var elements = Parse(input);

foreach (var element in elements)
{
    Console.WriteLine($"{new string('-', element.Children.Count)} {element.Name}");
}
//output
- root
-- child1
--- grandchild1
--- grandchild2
-- child2
--- grandchild3
---- greatgrandchild1
```

`Data visualization`: When visualizing large amounts of data, you may need to filter or transform the data before it is displayed. Using yield to process the data can allow you to do this on the fly, making your visualization more responsive and efficient.

`Recursive algorithms`: When writing recursive algorithms, you may need to traverse a large data structure. Using yield to generate the nodes of the data structure can make your code more elegant and easier to understand.

`Event-driven programming`: In event-driven programming, you often need to respond to events as they occur. Using yield to generate events can simplify your code and make it more maintainable.

`Filtering and transforming data`: yield can be used to filter or transform data on-the-fly as it is being processed. This can be useful for scenarios such as filtering out invalid data or transforming data into a different format.

# Iterators and try/catch/finally blocks
A yield return statement cannot appear in a try block that has a catch clause:

IEnumerable<string> Foo()
{
  try { yield return "One"; }    // Illegal
  catch { ... }
}
Nor can yield return appear in a catch or finally block. These restrictions are due to the fact that the compiler must translate iterators into ordinary classes with MoveNext, Current, and Dispose members, and translating exception-handling blocks would create excessive complexity.

You can, however, yield within a try block that has (only) a finally block:
```c#
IEnumerable<string> Foo()
{
  try { yield return "One"; }    // OK
  finally { ... }
}
```
The code in the finally block executes when the consuming enumerator reaches the end of the sequence or is disposed. A foreach statement implicitly disposes the enumerator if you break early, making this a safe way to consume enumerators. When working with enumerators explicitly, a trap is to abandon enumeration early without disposing it, circumventing the finally block. You can avoid this risk by wrapping explicit use of enumerators in a using statement:

string firstElement = null;
var sequence = Foo();
using (var enumerator = sequence.GetEnumerator())
  if (enumerator.MoveNext())

# Composing Sequences
Iterators are highly composable. We can extend our example, this time to output even Fibonacci numbers only:
```c#
using System;
using System.Collections.Generic;

foreach (int fib in EvenNumbersOnly (Fibs(6)))
  Console.WriteLine (fib);

IEnumerable<int> Fibs (int fibCount)
{
  for (int i = 0, prevFib = 1, curFib = 1; i < fibCount; i++)
  {
    yield return prevFib;
    int newFib = prevFib+curFib;
    prevFib = curFib;
    curFib = newFib;
  }
}

IEnumerable<int> EvenNumbersOnly (IEnumerable<int> sequence)
{
  foreach (int x in sequence)
    if ((x % 2) == 0)
      yield return x;
}

//OUTPUT
Order: EvenNumbersOnly -> Fibs -> print result
```

`The composability of the iterator pattern is extremely useful in LINQ; `
