# Extension Methods
Extension methods allow an existing type to be extended with new methods without altering the definition of the original type. An extension method is a static method of a static class, where the this modifier is applied to the first parameter. The type of the first parameter will be the type that is extended:

public static class StringHelper
{
  public static bool IsCapitalized (this string s)
  {
    if (string.IsNullOrEmpty(s)) return false;
    return char.IsUpper (s[0]);
  }
}
The IsCapitalized extension method can be called as though it were an instance method on a string, as follows:

Console.WriteLine ("Perth".IsCapitalized());
An extension method call, when compiled, is translated back into an ordinary static method call:

Console.WriteLine (StringHelper.IsCapitalized ("Perth"));
The translation works as follows:

arg0.Method (arg1, arg2, ...);              // Extension method call
StaticClass.Method (arg0, arg1, arg2, ...); // Static method call
Interfaces can be extended, too:

public static T First<T> (this IEnumerable<T> sequence)
{
  foreach (T element in sequence)
    return element;

  throw new InvalidOperationException ("No elements!");
}
...
Console.WriteLine ("Seattle".First());   // S

# Extension Method Chaining
Extension methods, like instance methods, provide a tidy way to chain functions. Consider the following two functions:

public static class StringHelper
{
  public static string Pluralize (this string s) {...}
  public static string Capitalize (this string s) {...}
}
x and y are equivalent, and both evaluate to "Sausages", but x uses extension methods, whereas y uses static methods:

string x = "sausage".Pluralize().Capitalize();
string y = StringHelper.Capitalize (StringHelper.Pluralize ("sausage"));
