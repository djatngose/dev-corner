# Anonymous Types
An anonymous type is a simple class created by the compiler on the fly to store a set of values. To create an anonymous type, use the new keyword followed by an object initializer, specifying the properties and values the type will contain; for example:

var dude = new { Name = "Bob", Age = 23 };
The compiler translates this to (approximately) the following:

internal class AnonymousGeneratedTypeName
{
  private string name;  // Actual field name is irrelevant
  private int    age;   // Actual field name is irrelevant

  public AnonymousGeneratedTypeName (string name, int age)
  {
    this.name = name; this.age = age;
  }

  public string  Name { get { return name; } }
  public int     Age  { get { return age;  } }

  // The Equals and GetHashCode methods are overridden (see Chapter 6).
  // The ToString method is also overridden.
}
...

var dude = new AnonymousGeneratedTypeName ("Bob", 23);
You must use the var keyword to reference an anonymous type because it doesnâ€™t have a name.

The property name of an anonymous type can be inferred from an expression that is itself an identifier (or ends with one); thus

int Age = 23;
var dude = new { Name = "Bob", Age, Age.ToString().Length };
is equivalent to the following:

var dude = new { Name = "Bob", Age = Age, Length = Age.ToString().Length };
Two anonymous type instances declared within the same assembly will have the same underlying type if their elements are named and typed identically:

var a1 = new { X = 2, Y = 4 };
var a2 = new { X = 2, Y = 4 };
Console.WriteLine (a1.GetType() == a2.GetType());   // True
Additionally, the Equals method is overridden to perform structural equality comparison (comparison of the data):

Console.WriteLine (a1.Equals (a2));   // True
whereas the equality operator (==) performs referential comparison:

Console.WriteLine (a1 == a2);         // False
You can create arrays of anonymous types as follows:

var dudes = new[]
{
  new { Name = "Bob", Age = 30 },
  new { Name = "Tom", Age = 40 }
};
A method cannot (usefully) return an anonymously typed object, because it is illegal to write a method whose return type is var:

var Foo() => new { Name = "Bob", Age = 30 };  // Not legal!
Instead, you must use object or dynamic, and then whoever calls Foo must rely on dynamic binding, with loss of static type safety (and IntelliSense in Visual Studio):

dynamic Foo() => new { Name = "Bob", Age = 30 };  // No static type safety.
Anonymous types are immutable, so instances cannot be modified after creation. However, from C# 10, you can use the with keyword to create a copy with variations (nondestructive mutation):

var a1 = new { A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, D = 4, E = 5 };
var a2 = a1 with { E = 10 }; 
Console.WriteLine (a2);      // { A = 1, B = 2, C = 3, D = 4, E = 10 }
