# Records
A record is a special kind of class or struct that’s designed to work well with immutable (read-only) data. Its most useful feature is nondestructive mutation; however, records are also useful in creating types that just combine or hold data. In simple cases, they eliminate boilerplate code while honoring the equality semantics most suitable for immutable types.

Records are purely a C# compile-time construct. At runtime, the CLR sees them just as classes or structs (with a bunch of extra “synthesized” members added by the compiler).
Records are `reference types` by default. This means that when you create an instance of a record using the new keyword, a reference to the instance is returned. However, records can also be declared as readonly struct, which would make them value types. In this case, the record instances would be stored directly on the stack rather than in the heap, which can offer some performance benefits.
```c#
public record Person(string FirstName, string LastName, int Age);

```
This record defines a person with a first name, last name, and age. The record keyword is used to declare that this is a record type. The record has three properties: FirstName, LastName, and Age.

Records are similar to classes and structs in that they can have properties and methods, but there are some important differences. For example, records are immutable by default, meaning that their properties cannot be changed once they are created. Records also have some additional features, such as built-in value-based equality and hash code generation.

Here's an example of how you might create and use an instance of the Person record:
```c#
var person = new Person("John", "Doe", 30);
Console.WriteLine($"Name: {person.FirstName} {person.LastName}, Age: {person.Age}");

```
This creates a new Person record with the first name "John", last name "Doe", and age 30, and then prints out their name and age to the console.

Since records are immutable, you cannot change their properties directly. Instead, you create a new record instance with the updated values, like this:
```c#
var updatedPerson = person with { Age = 31 };
Console.WriteLine($"Name: {updatedPerson.FirstName} {updatedPerson.LastName}, Age: {updatedPerson.Age}");

```
here is an example of declaring a record as a record struct:
```c#
public record struct Person
{
    public string FirstName { get; init; }
    public string LastName { get; init; }
    public int Age { get; init; }
}

```
In this example, the Person record is declared as a readonly struct instead of a class. This means that instances of the Person record will be treated as value types instead of reference types. The readonly keyword ensures that the instance fields of the record cannot be modified after initialization.

You can create an instance of this record as follows:

```c#
Person person = new("John", "Doe", 30);
```
In this example, a new instance of the Person record is created and initialized with the values "John" for the FirstName property, "Doe" for the LastName property, and 30 for the Age property. This instance is now a value type and can be passed by value instead of by reference.
# Background
Writing immutable types (whose fields cannot be modified after initialization) is a popular strategy for simplifying software and reducing bugs. It’s also a core aspect of functional programming, where mutable state is avoided and functions are treated as data. LINQ is inspired by this principle.

In order to “modify” an immutable object, you must create a new one and copy over the data while incorporating your modifications (this is called nondestructive mutation). In terms of performance, this is not as inefficient as you might expect, because a shallow copy will always suffice (a deep copy, where you also copy subobjects and collections, is unnecessary when data is immutable). But in terms of coding effort, implementing nondestructive mutation can be very inefficient, especially when there are many properties. Records solve this problem via a language-supported pattern.

A second issue is that programmers—particularly functional programmers—sometimes use immutable types just to combine data (without adding behavior). Defining such types is more work than it should be, requiring a constructor to assign each parameter to each property (a deconstructor may also be useful). With records, the compiler can do this work for you.

Finally, one of the consequences of an object being immutable is that its identity cannot change, which means that it’s more useful for such types to implement structural equality than referential equality. Structural equality means that two instances are the same if their data is the same (as with tuples). Records give you structural equality by default—regardless of whether the underlying type is a class or struct—without any boilerplate code.

# Defining a Record
A record definition is like a class or struct definition, and can contain the same kinds of members, including fields, properties, methods, and so on. Records can implement interfaces, and (class-based) records can subclass other (class-based) records.

By default, the underlying type of a record is a class:
```c#
record Point { }          // Point is a class
```
From C# 10, the underlying type of a record can also be a struct:
```c#
record struct Point { }   // Point is a struct
```
(record class is also legal and has the same meaning as record.)
A simple record might contain just a bunch of init-only properties and perhaps a constructor:

record Point
{
  public Point (double x, double y) => (X, Y) = (x, y);

  public double X { get; init; }
  public double Y { get; init; }    
}

`NOTE`:
Our constructor employs a shortcut that we described in the preceding section.

(X, Y) = (x, y);
is equivalent (in this case) to the following:

{ this.X = x; this.Y = y; }

Upon compilation, C# transforms the record definition into a class (or struct) and performs the following additional steps:

It writes a protected copy constructor (and a hidden Clone method) to facilitate nondestructive mutation.

It overrides/overloads the equality-related functions to implement structural equality.

It overrides the ToString() method (to expand the record’s public properties, as with anonymous types).

The preceding record declaration expands into something like this:
```c#
class Point
{  
  public Point (double x, double y) => (X, Y) = (x, y);

  public double X { get; init; }
  public double Y { get; init; }    

  protected Point (Point original)    // “Copy constructor”
  {
    this.X = original.X; this.Y = original.Y
  }

  // This method has a strange compiler-generated name:
  public virtual Point <Clone>$() => new Point (this);   // Clone method

  // Additional code to override Equals, ==, !=, GetHashCode, ToString()
  // ...
}
```
`NOTE`
While there’s nothing to stop you from putting optional parameters into the constructor, a good pattern (at least in public libraries) is to leave them out of the constructor and expose them purely as init-only properties:

new Foo (123, 234) { Optional2 = 345 };

record Foo
{
  public Foo (int required1, int required2) { ... }

  public int Required1 { get; init; }
  public int Required2 { get; init; }

  public int Optional1 { get; init; }
  public int Optional2 { get; init; }
}
The advantage of this pattern is that you can safely add init-only properties later without breaking binary compatibility with consumers who have compiled against older versions of your assembly.

# Parameter lists
A record definition can also include a parameter list:

record Point (double X, double Y)
{
  // You can optionally define additional class members here...
}
Parameters can include the in and params modifiers, but not out or ref. If a parameter list is specified, the compiler performs the following extra steps:

  - It writes an init-only property per parameter.
  - It writes a primary constructor to populate the properties.
  - It writes a deconstructor.

# MUTABILITY WITH RECORD STRUCTS
When you define a parameter list in a record struct, the compiler emits writable properties instead of init-only properties, unless you prefix the record declaration with readonly:

readonly record struct Point (double X, double Y);
The rationale is that in typical use cases, the safety benefits of immutability arise not from a struct being immutable but from its home being immutable. In the following example, we are unable to mutate field X, even though X is writable:

var test = new Immutable();
test.Field.X++;  // Prohibited, because Field is readonly
test.Prop.X++;   // Prohibited, because Prop is {get;} only

class Immutable
{
  public readonly Mutable Field;
  public Mutable Prop { get; }
}

struct Mutable { public int X, Y; }

And while we could do the following:

var test = new Immutable();
Mutable m = test.Prop;
m.X++; 
all that we would achieve is to mutate a local variable (a copy of test.Prop). Mutating a local variable can be a useful optimization and doesn’t invalidate the benefits of an immutable type system.

Conversely, if we made Field a writable field, and Prop a writable property, we could simply replace their contents—regardless of how the Mutable struct was declared.

This means that if we declare our Point record simply as

record Point (double X, double Y);
the compiler will end up generating (almost) exactly what we listed in the preceding expansion. A minor difference is that the parameter names in the primary constructor will end up as X and Y instead of x and y:

the compiler will end up generating (almost) exactly what we listed in the preceding expansion. A minor difference is that the parameter names in the primary constructor will end up as X and Y instead of x and y:

  public Point (double X, double Y)   // “Primary constructor”
  {
    this.X = X; this.Y = Y;
  }

Another difference, when you define a parameter list, is that the compiler also generates a deconstructor:

  public void Deconstruct (out double X, out double Y)   // Deconstructor
  {
    X = this.X; Y = this.Y;
  }
Records with parameter lists can be subclassed using the following syntax:

record Point3D (double X, double Y, double Z) : Point (X, Y);
The compiler then emits a primary constructor as follows:

class Point3D : Point
{
  public double Z { get; init; }

  public Point3D (double X, double Y, double Z) : base (X, Y) 
    => this.Z = Z;
}

# Nondestructive Mutation
The most important step that the compiler performs with all records is to write a copy constructor (and a hidden Clone method). This enables nondestructive mutation via the with keyword:

Point p1 = new Point (3, 3);
Point p2 = p1 with { Y = 4 };
Console.WriteLine (p2);       // Point { X = 3, Y = 4 }

record Point (double X, double Y);
In this example, p2 is a copy of p1, but with its Y property set to 4. The benefit is more apparent when there are more properties:

Test t1 = new Test (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8);
Test t2 = t1 with { A = 10, C = 30 };
Console.WriteLine (t2);

record Test (int A, int B, int C, int D, int E, int F, int G, int H);
Here’s the output:

Test { A = 10, B = 2, C = 30, D = 4, E = 5, F = 6, G = 7, H = 8 }
Nondestructive mutation occurs in two phases:

First, the copy constructor clones the record. By default, it copies each of the record’s underlying fields, creating a faithful replica while bypassing (the overhead of) any logic in the init accessors. All fields are included (public and private, as well as the hidden fields that back automatic properties).

Then, each property in the member initializer list is updated (this time using the init accessors).

The compiler translates:

Test t2 = t1 with { A = 10, C = 30 };
into something functionally equivalent to the following:

Test t2 = new Test(t1);  // Use copy constructor to clone t1 field by field
t2.A = 10;               // Update property A
t2.C = 30;               // Update property C
(The same code would not compile if you wrote it explicitly because A and C are init-only properties. Furthermore, the copy constructor is protected; C# works around this by invoking it via a public hidden method that it writes into the record called <Clone>$.)

If necessary, you can define your own copy constructor. C# will then use your definition instead of writing one itself:

protected Point (Point original)
{
  this.X = original.X; this.Y = original.Y;
}
Writing a custom copy constructor might be useful if your record contains mutable subobjects or collections that you wish to clone, or if there are computed fields that you wish to clear. Unfortunately, you can only replace, not enhance, the default implementation.

NOTE
When subclassing another record, the copy constructor is responsible for copying only its own fields. To copy the base record’s fields, delegate to the base:

protected Point (Point original) : base (original)
{
  ...
}

# Property Validation
With explicit properties, you can write validation logic into the init accessors. In the following example, we ensure that X can never be NaN (Not a Number):

record Point
{
  // Notice that we assign x to the X property (and not the _x field):
  public Point (double x, double y) => (X, Y) = (x, y);

  double _x;
  public double X
  { 
    get => _x;
    init
    {
      if (double.IsNaN (value))
        throw new ArgumentException ("X Cannot be NaN");
      _x = value;
    }
  }
  public double Y { get; init; }    
}
Our design ensures that validation occurs both during construction and when the object is nondestructively mutated:

Point p1 = new Point (2, 3);
Point p2 = p1 with { X = double.NaN };   // throws an exception
Recall that the automatically generated copy constructor copies over all fields and automatic properties. This means that the generated copy constructor will now look like this:

protected Point (Point original)
 {
   _x = original._x; Y = original.Y;
 }
Notice that the copying of the _x field circumvents the X property accessor. However, this cannot break anything, because it’s faithfully copying an object that will have already been safely populated via X’s init accessor.

# Calculated Fields and Lazy Evaluation
A popular functional programming pattern that works well with immutable types is lazy evaluation, where a value is not computed until required, and is then cached for reuse. Suppose, for instance, that we want to define a property in our Point record that returns the distance from the origin (0, 0):

record Point (double X, double Y)
{
  public double DistanceFromOrigin => Math.Sqrt (X*X + Y*Y);
}
Let’s now try to refactor this to avoid the cost of recomputing DistanceFromOrigin every time the property is accessed. We’ll start by removing the property list and defining X, Y, and DistanceFromOrigin as read-only properties. Then we can calculate the latter in the constructor:

record Point
{
  public double X { get; }
  public double Y { get; }
  public double DistanceFromOrigin { get; }

  public Point (double x, double y) =>
    (X, Y, DistanceFromOrigin) = (x, y, Math.Sqrt (x*x + y*y));
}
This works, but it doesn’t allow for nondestructive mutation (changing X and Y to init-only properties would break the code because DistanceFromOrigin would become stale after the init accessors execute). It’s also suboptimal in that the calculation is always performed, regardless of whether the DistanceFromOrigin property is ever read. The optimal solution is to cache its value in a field and populate it lazily (on first use):

record Point
{
  ...

  double? _distance;
  public double DistanceFromOrigin
  {
    get
    {
      if (_distance == null) 
        _distance = Math.Sqrt (X*X + Y*Y);

      return _distance.Value;
    }
  }
}
NOTE
Technically, we mutate _distance in this code. It’s still fair, though, to call Point an immutable type. Mutating a field purely to populate a lazy value does not invalidate the principles or benefits of immutability, and can even be masked through the use of the Lazy<T> type that we describe in Chapter 21.

With C#’s null-coalescing assignment operator (??=) we can reduce the entire property declaration to one line of code:

  public double DistanceFromOrigin => _distance ??= Math.Sqrt (X*X + Y*Y);
(This says, return _distance if it’s non-null; otherwise return Math.Sqrt (X*X + Y*Y) while assigning it to _distance.)

To make this work with init-only properties, we need one further step, which is to clear the cached _distance field when X or Y is updated via the init accessor. Here’s the complete code:

record Point
{
  public Point (double x, double y) => (X, Y) = (x, y);

  double _x, _y;
  public double X { get => _x; init { _x = value; _distance = null; } }
  public double Y { get => _y; init { _y = value; _distance = null; } }
    
  double? _distance;
  public double DistanceFromOrigin => _distance ??= Math.Sqrt (X*X + Y*Y);
}
Point can now be mutated nondestructively:

Point p1 = new Point (2, 3);
Console.WriteLine (p1.DistanceFromOrigin);   // 3.605551275463989
Point p2 = p1 with { Y = 4 };
Console.WriteLine (p2.DistanceFromOrigin);   // 4.47213595499958
A nice bonus is that the autogenerated copy constructor copies over the cached _distance field. This means that should a record have other properties that aren’t involved in the calculation, a nondestructive mutation of those properties wouldn’t trigger an unnecessary loss of the cached value. If you don’t care for this bonus, an alternative to clearing the cached value in the init accessors is to write a custom copy constructor that ignores the cached field. This is more concise because it works with parameter lists, and the custom copy constructor can leverage the deconstructor:

record Point (double X, double Y)
{
  double? _distance;
  public double DistanceFromOrigin => _distance ??= Math.Sqrt (X*X + Y*Y);

  protected Point (Point other) => (X, Y) = other;
}
Note that with either solution, the addition of lazy calculated fields breaks the default structural equality comparison (because such fields may or may not be populated), although we’ll see shortly that it’s relatively easy to fix.

# Records and Equality Comparison
Just as with structs, anonymous types, and tuples, records provide structural equality out of the box, meaning that two records are equal if their fields (and automatic properties) are equal:

var p1 = new Point (1, 2);
var p2 = new Point (1, 2);
Console.WriteLine (p1.Equals (p2));   // True

record Point (double X, double Y);
The equality operator also works with records (as it does with tuples):

Console.WriteLine (p1 == p2);         // True

The default equality implementation for records is unavoidably fragile. In particular, it breaks if the record contains lazy values, transient values, arrays, or collection types (which require special handling for equality comparison). Fortunately, it’s relatively easy to fix (should you need equality to work), and doing so is less work than adding full equality behavior to classes or structs.

Unlike with classes and structs, you do not (and cannot) override the object.Equals method; instead, you define a public Equals method with the following signature:

record Point (double X, double Y)
{
  double _someOtherField;
  public virtual bool Equals (Point other) =>
    other != null && X == other.X && Y == other.Y;
}
The Equals method must be virtual (not override), and it must be strongly typed such that it accepts the actual record type (Point in this case, not object). Once you get the signature right, the compiler will automatically patch in your method.

In our example, we changed the equality logic such that we compare only X and Y (and ignore _someOtherField).

Should you subclass another record, you can call the base.Equals method:

  public virtual bool Equals (Point other) => base.Equals (other) && ...
As with any type, if you take over equality comparison, you should also override GetHashCode(). A nice feature of records is that you don’t overload != or ==; nor do you implement IEquatable<T>: this is all done for you. We cover this topic of equality comparison fully in “Equality Comparison”.

# when use record?
 Records can be used in situations where you need to create classes with a large number of properties that don't change once they are initialized.

Some common scenarios where records are useful include:

  - Data transfer objects (DTOs): Records can be used to define simple classes for holding data that is passed between layers of an application or between different services.
  - Configuration data: Records can be used to define classes for holding configuration data that is loaded from external sources like XML files or JSON files.
  - Domain entities: Records can be used to define classes for holding data that represents domain entities like customers, orders, or products.
  - View models: Records can be used to define classes for holding data that is displayed in a user interface.

Records provide several benefits over traditional classes, including:

  - Concise syntax: Records provide a shorter syntax for defining classes that hold immutable data, reducing the amount of boilerplate code you need to write.
  - Value equality by default: Records provide value-based equality semantics by default, meaning that two instances of a record with the same values are considered equal.
  - Structural typing: Records support structural typing, which means that two record types with the same properties and types are considered the same type, even if they have different names.

# what's different between struct and record?
## Short version
Can your data type be a value type? Go with struct. No? Does your type describe a value-like, preferably immutable state? Go with record.

Use class otherwise. So...

Yes, use records for your DTOs if it is one way flow.
Yes, immutable request bindings are an ideal user case for a record
Yes, SearchParameters are an ideal user case for a record.
## Long version
A struct, a class and a record are user data types.

Structures are value types. Classes are reference types. Records are by default immutable reference types.

When you need some sort of hierarchy to describe your data types like inheritance or a struct pointing to another struct or basically things pointing to other things, you need a reference type.

Records solve the problem when you want your type to be a value oriented by default. Records are reference types but with the value oriented semantic.

Does your data type respect all of these rules:

It logically represents a single value, similar to primitive types (int, double, etc.).
It has an instance size under 16 bytes.
It is immutable.
It will not have to be boxed frequently.
Yes? It should be a struct.
No? It should be some reference type.

Does your data type encapsulate some sort of a complex value? Is the value immutable? Do you use it in unidirectional (one way) flow?

Yes? Go with record.
No? Go with class.

Use a class when you need reference semantics, and the data is complex and requires a large number of methods and properties.

Use a struct when you need value semantics, and the data is small, simple, and requires minimal behavior.

Use a record when you need reference semantics with value-based equality, and the data is immutable or mostly immutable.They have built-in support for value-based equality and hashing, and they can be deconstructed and copied easily.

`Here are some examples of when to use each type:`

Use a class for modeling a complex object that needs to have many methods and properties, such as a user account in a web application.
  - Large, complex objects that need to be shared among multiple parts of a program
  - Objects that require a lot of memory or processing power to create or manipulate
  - Objects that need to support inheritance or polymorphism
  - Objects that need to maintain state over time, such as UI controls or database connections

Use a struct for modeling a small, simple data type that needs to be passed around frequently, such as a point in a 2D graphics application.
  - Small, simple objects that can be copied efficiently
  - Objects that represent simple values, such as points or color values
  - Objects that are used frequently and need to be passed around quickly, such as in game development or numerical computing
  - Objects that are not frequently modified and do not need to maintain state over time

Use a record for modeling immutable or mostly immutable data types that need to be compared based on their values, such as a person's name and address.
  - Objects that are primarily used for data storage and manipulation
  - Objects that are frequently compared for equality or hashed
  - Objects that need to be deconstructed or copied frequently
  - Objects that need to be immutable to ensure thread safety or prevent unintended modifications

# API requesst and response object should use record or class?
`Records` can be a good fit for API request and response objects because they are designed for representing immutable data with a concise syntax. Records also provide built-in value-based equality semantics and support for deconstruction, which can make working with API data more intuitive and efficient.

On the other hand, `classes` provide more flexibility for representing complex API objects with mutable state and behavior. Classes can also support inheritance, which can be useful for building object hierarchies and implementing interfaces.
