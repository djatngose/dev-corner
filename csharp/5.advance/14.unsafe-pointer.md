# Unsafe Code and Pointers
C# supports direct memory manipulation via pointers within blocks of code marked unsafe and compiled with the /unsafe compiler option. Pointer types are primarily useful for interoperability with C APIs, but you also can use them for accessing memory outside the managed heap or for performance-critical hotspots.

# Pointer Basics
For every value type or reference type V, there is a corresponding pointer type V*. A pointer instance holds the address of a variable. Pointer types can be (unsafely) cast to any other pointer type. Following are the main pointer operators:

Operator	Meaning
`&	`The address-of operator returns a pointer to the address of a variable.
`*	`The dereference operator returns the variable at the address of a pointer.
->	The pointer-to-member operator is a syntactic shortcut, in which x->y is equivalent to (*x).y.
In keeping with C, adding (or subtracting) an integer offset to a pointer generates another pointer. Subtracting one pointer from another generates a 64-bit integer (on both 64-bit and 32-bit platforms).

# Unsafe Code
By marking a type, type member, or statement block with the unsafe keyword, you’re permitted to use pointer types and perform C style pointer operations on memory within that scope. Here is an example of using pointers to quickly process a bitmap:

unsafe void BlueFilter (int[,] bitmap)
{
  int length = bitmap.Length;
  fixed (int* b = bitmap)
  {
    int* p = b;
    for (int i = 0; i < length; i++)
      *p++ &= 0xFF;
  }
}

# The fixed Statement
The fixed statement is required to pin a managed object, such as the bitmap in the previous example. During the execution of a program, many objects are allocated and deallocated from the heap. To avoid unnecessary waste or fragmentation of memory, the garbage collector moves objects around. Pointing to an object is futile if its address could change while referencing it, so the fixed statement tells the garbage collector to “pin” the object and not move it around. This can have an impact on the efficiency of the runtime, so you should use fixed blocks only briefly, and you should avoid heap allocation within the fixed block.

Within a fixed statement, you can get a pointer to any value type, an array of value types, or a string. In the case of arrays and strings, the pointer will actually point to the first element, which is a value type.

Value types declared inline within reference types require the reference type to be pinned, as follows:
```c#
Test test = new Test();
unsafe
{
  fixed (int* p = &test.X)   // Pins test
  {
    *p = 9;
  }
  Console.WriteLine (test.X);
}

class Test { public int X; }
```
In C#, the fixed statement is used to create a fixed-size buffer in memory for unsafe code. The fixed statement can also be used to pin an object in memory to avoid garbage collection during unsafe code execution.

In the code you provided, the fixed statement is used to pin the object test in memory. This is done by taking the address of the X field in the Test object using the & operator, and assigning it to a pointer variable p. The *p = 9 line then updates the value of X to 9 using the pointer. Without the fixed statement, the garbage collector could move the test object in memory, causing the pointer p to point to an invalid memory location, resulting in undefined behavior.

Therefore, by using fixed, you are instructing the garbage collector to not move the object test in memory, hence "pinning" it.

# when to use fixed?
Interop with unmanaged code: When calling unmanaged code from managed code, you might need to pass pointers to managed objects to the unmanaged code. Before passing the pointers, you need to pin the managed objects in memory to prevent them from being moved by the garbage collector. This is done using the fixed keyword.

Performance optimization: In some cases, using the fixed keyword can improve performance. For example, if you have a large array that is accessed frequently in an unsafe context, pinning the array in memory using fixed can improve performance by reducing the overhead of garbage collection.

Working with low-level memory: If you need to work with low-level memory in C#, such as reading and writing individual bytes or words, you might need to use fixed to pin the memory in place before accessing it.

# Can you write an example with Working with low-level memory using fixed improve performance?
Suppose you have a program that needs to perform a large number of calculations on a large array of numbers. One way to do this is to use a for loop to iterate through the array and perform the calculations one element at a time. However, this can be slow if the array is very large, because the CPU has to load each element from memory and store the result back to memory for each iteration of the loop.

Instead, you can use fixed to pin the array in memory and access its elements directly using pointers. This can significantly improve performance by reducing the number of memory accesses needed.

Here's an example:

```c#
using System;

class Program
{
    static void Main()
    {
        int[] numbers = new int[1000000];

        // Initialize the array
        for (int i = 0; i < numbers.Length; i++)
        {
            numbers[i] = i;
        }

        // Calculate the sum of the array
        int sum = 0;
        unsafe
        {
            fixed (int* pNumbers = numbers)
            {
                int* p = pNumbers;
                for (int i = 0; i < numbers.Length; i++)
                {
                    sum += *p;
                    p++;
                }
            }
        }
        Console.WriteLine("Sum = " + sum);
    }
}
```
In this example, we create an array of 1,000,000 integers and initialize it with values from 0 to 999,999. We then use fixed to pin the array in memory and access its elements directly using pointers. Finally, we calculate the sum of the array by iterating over the elements using pointer arithmetic.

This code will be faster than using a for loop to iterate over the array because it avoids the overhead of loading and storing each element from memory. Instead, it keeps the array pinned in memory and accesses its elements directly using pointers.

# The stackalloc Keyword
You can allocate memory in a block on the stack explicitly by using the stackalloc keyword. Because it is allocated on the stack, its lifetime is limited to the execution of the method, just as with any other local variable (whose life hasn’t been extended by virtue of being captured by a lambda expression, iterator block, or asynchronous function). The block can use the [] operator to index into memory:

```c#
int* a = stackalloc int [10];
for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
   Console.WriteLine (a[i]);
```
we describe how you can use Span<T> to manage stack-allocated memory without using the unsafe keyword:
```c#
Span<int> a = stackalloc int [10];
for (int i = 0; i < 10; ++i)
  Console.WriteLine (a[i]);   
```
## when to use The stackalloc Keyword in c#?
This can be useful in scenarios where you need to allocate small amounts of memory quickly, such as in performance-critical code.

Some scenarios where stackalloc can be used include:
  - `Working with arrays`: If you need to create a small array of integers, for example, using stackalloc can be more efficient than creating a dynamic array on the heap.
  - `Manipulating memory`: If you need to manipulate memory directly, such as copying or moving data around, stackalloc can be more efficient than using the Marshal class or other methods.
  - `Performance optimization`: In some scenarios, using stackalloc can help to improve the performance of your code by reducing heap allocations and reducing the number of times garbage collection needs to run.

```c#
unsafe void Example()
{
    int* numbers = stackalloc int[10];
    for (int i = 0; i < 10; i++)
    {
        numbers[i] = i;
    }
}
```
we allocate an array of 10 integers on the stack using stackalloc. We can then use this array to store and manipulate data directly. Note that the unsafe keyword is used to allow us to use pointers in our code.

# stackalloc vs marshal?
`stackalloc` is a C# keyword that allows you to allocate memory on the stack instead of the heap. It is useful for scenarios where you need to allocate a small amount of memory quickly, such as when working with arrays or when doing low-level memory manipulation. Because the memory is allocated on the stack, it is automatically deallocated when the function that uses it returns, so you don't need to worry about manually freeing the memory. stackalloc is a fast and efficient way to allocate memory, but it has some limitations, such as the fact that the amount of memory you can allocate is limited by the size of the stack.

`Marshal`, on the other hand, is a class in the .NET framework that provides a set of methods for working with unmanaged memory, such as memory allocated by C or C++ code. The Marshal class provides methods for allocating and freeing memory, copying memory, and converting between managed and unmanaged types. Marshal is useful when you need to interoperate with unmanaged code, but it is slower than stackalloc because it involves copying memory between managed and unmanaged memory.

In summary, stackalloc is used to allocate memory on the stack quickly and efficiently, while Marshal is used to work with unmanaged memory and interoperate with unmanaged code.

# Fixed-Size Buffers
The fixed keyword has another use, which is to create fixed-size buffers within structs (this can be useful when calling an unmanaged function; see Chapter 24):
```c#
new UnsafeClass ("Christian Troy");

unsafe struct UnsafeUnicodeString
{
  public short Length;
  public fixed byte Buffer[30];   // Allocate block of 30 bytes
}

unsafe class UnsafeClass
{
  UnsafeUnicodeString uus;

  public UnsafeClass (string s)
  {
    uus.Length = (short)s.Length;
    fixed (byte* p = uus.Buffer)
      for (int i = 0; i < s.Length; i++)
        p[i] = (byte) s[i];
  }
}
```
`This field declares a fixed-size buffer named Buffer that has a size of 30 bytes. The fixed keyword indicates that the memory for this buffer is allocated on the stack, and the size is determined at compile-time.`

`Fixed-size buffers are not arrays`: if Buffer were an array, it would consist of a reference to an object stored on the (managed) heap, rather than 30 bytes within the struct itself.

The fixed keyword is also used in this example to pin the object on the heap that contains the buffer (which will be the instance of UnsafeClass). Hence, fixed means two different things: fixed in size and fixed in place. The two are often used together, in that a fixed-size buffer must be fixed in place to be used.

`Fixed in size`: This refers to an array with a fixed number of elements, whose size cannot change at runtime. This is achieved using the fixed statement, which pins the array in memory and provides a pointer to its first element. This can be useful in cases where the size of the array is known in advance and does not need to change.

`Fixed in place:` This refers to a block of memory that is allocated on the stack using the stackalloc keyword. This is a way of allocating memory that is faster than allocating memory on the heap, but it comes with the restriction that the memory is only valid for the lifetime of the method in which it is allocated. This can be useful in cases where you need to allocate a small amount of memory quickly, but don't need to keep it around for very long.

# Void pointer
`A void pointer, also known as a generic pointer`, is a pointer that has no associated data type. It is a type of pointer that can point to any type of data, but the data must be explicitly cast to the correct type before it can be accessed or manipulated.

Void pointers are useful in situations where the type of data being pointed to is not known at compile time, or when working with data of different types. They are commonly used in low-level programming and system programming, where access to memory locations and hardware devices is required.

One common use case for void pointers is in the implementation of dynamic memory allocation functions, such as malloc() and calloc(). These functions return a void pointer to a block of memory that can be used to store data of any type.

Another use case is in inter-process communication, where data is exchanged between processes that may have different data types. In this case, void pointers can be used to pass data between processes, and the receiving process can cast the data to the correct type before using it.

It is important to note that the use of void pointers can be unsafe if not used carefully, as they can lead to type errors and memory corruption if used improperly. As a result, it is recommended to use void pointers only when necessary, and to use them with caution and care.
```c#
short[] a = { 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55 };
unsafe
{
  fixed (short* p = a)
  {
    //sizeof returns size of value-type in bytes
    Zap (p, a.Length * sizeof (short));
  }
}
foreach (short x in a)
  System.Console.WriteLine (x);   // Prints all zeros

unsafe void Zap (void* memory, int byteCount)
{
  byte* b = (byte*)memory;
  for (int i = 0; i < byteCount; i++)
    *b++ = 0;
}
```

# Native-Sized Integers
Native-sized integers are used in scenarios where you need to store or manipulate data in the same size as the native size of the processor architecture. In C#, the native size of an integer is determined by the processor architecture on which the program is running.

One common scenario where native-sized integers are used is when working with unmanaged code or interop scenarios, where you need to interact with native libraries that expect data in a certain format. For example, when calling into a C++ library that uses 32-bit integers, you might use a native-sized integer in your C# code to match the expected data format.

Another scenario where native-sized integers might be used is when working with low-level memory operations, such as manipulating memory buffers directly or working with low-level protocols. In these cases, using native-sized integers can help improve performance by avoiding unnecessary type conversions or memory operations.

A good example of the real-world use of nint and nuint is in the implementation of Buffer.MemoryCopy. You can see this in the .NET source code for Buffer.cs on GitHub or by decompiling the method in ILSpy. A simplified version has also been included in the LINQPad samples for C# 10 in a Nutshell.

# Function Pointers
unction pointers are a feature in C and C++ that allow you to pass a reference to a function as a parameter to another function or store it in a data structure. Here are some scenarios where function pointers can be useful:

Callbacks: In event-driven programming, callbacks are commonly used to handle events such as mouse clicks or keyboard presses. Function pointers can be used to specify the callback function to be executed when the event occurs.

Sorting: Function pointers can be used to specify the comparison function used by sorting algorithms such as qsort in C.

Dynamic binding: In object-oriented programming languages such as C++, function pointers can be used to implement dynamic binding, which allows a method to be called on an object at runtime, based on the actual type of the object rather than its declared type.

Dispatch tables: Function pointers can be used to implement dispatch tables, which are data structures that map input values to functions that perform specific actions based on the input.

Polymorphism: In languages that support function pointers and allow functions to be defined with the same signature, function pointers can be used to achieve polymorphism, where different functions can be called based on the type of the input.

In C#, function pointers are used in advanced scenarios where low-level control of memory is required, such as in interop scenarios where you need to call native code. Function pointers allow you to create delegates that point to unmanaged code, which can be used to call native functions that are not exposed as managed methods.

Function pointers are also used in high-performance scenarios where dynamic dispatch is required, such as in dynamic code generation, dynamic proxies, or dynamic method invocation. In these scenarios, you can use function pointers to create delegates that can be invoked dynamically, without the overhead of reflection.

However, it is important to note that function pointers in C# are not used as frequently as they are in lower-level languages like C or C++. In C#, delegates are generally used to handle callbacks and event notifications, and the use of function pointers is limited to advanced scenarios where low-level control of memory is required.

A function pointer (from C# 9) is like a delegate, but without the indirection of a delegate instance; instead, it points directly to a method. A function pointer can point only to static methods, lacks multicast capability, and requires an unsafe context (because it bypasses runtime type safety). Its main purpose is to simplify and optimize interop with unmanaged APIs 

A function pointer type is declared as follows (with the return type appearing last):

delegate*<int, char, string, void>   // (void refers to the return type)
This matches a function with this signature:

void SomeFunction (int x, char y, string z)
The & operator creates a function pointer from a method group. Here’s a complete example:

unsafe
{
  delegate*<string, int> functionPointer = &GetLength;
  int length = functionPointer ("Hello, world");

  static int GetLength (string s) => s.Length;
}
In this example, functionPointer is not an object upon which you can call a method such as Invoke (or with a reference to a Target object). Instead, it’s a variable that points directly to the target method’s address in memory:

Console.WriteLine ((IntPtr)functionPointer);
Like any other pointer, it’s not subject to runtime type checking. The following treats our function’s return value as a decimal (which, being longer than an int, means that we incorporate some random memory into the output):

var pointer2 = (delegate*<string, decimal>) (IntPtr) functionPointer;
Console.WriteLine (pointer2 ("Hello, unsafe world"));

# [SkipLocalsInit]
SkipLocalsInit is a feature introduced in C# 7.3 that allows skipping the initialization of local variables, including value types, to improve performance in certain scenarios. When this feature is enabled, the compiler generates IL code that does not initialize local variables to their default values (such as zero for numbers and false for booleans) before use.

By skipping the initialization of local variables, the generated IL code can avoid unnecessary writes to memory, which can be beneficial in high-performance scenarios where every CPU cycle counts, such as in game development, high-performance computing, or real-time systems.

However, it's important to note that skipping the initialization of local variables can also introduce security risks, as uninitialized memory can contain sensitive information left over from previous operations or from other processes. Therefore, this feature should be used with caution and only in scenarios where the potential performance gains outweigh the security risks.

Suppose you have the following code:

```c#
int x;
Console.WriteLine(x);
```
Normally, when this code runs, the compiler initializes x to its default value, which is 0. However, if you add the SkipLocalsInit flag, the compiler skips this initialization step. So if you rewrite the code like this:

```c#
int x;
Console.WriteLine(x, skipLocalsInit: true);
```
When you run the code, the value of x will be undefined. It may contain any value that happens to be in memory at that location, because the compiler does not guarantee that it has been initialized.

This can be useful in certain scenarios where you don't actually need the variable to be initialized before you use it, or where you know that the variable will be initialized by other means (such as by reading input from the user or from a file). By skipping the initialization step, you can potentially save some time and memory in your program. However, it's important to be careful when using this flag, because uninitialized variables can lead to unexpected behavior and bugs in your code.

## here are some examples of the risks of using skipLocalsInit=true:
`
Uninitialized variables`: When skipLocalsInit is set to true, the runtime skips the initialization of local variables. This can result in uninitialized variables, which can cause undefined behavior, such as incorrect calculations or even program crashes.

`Information leaks`: If the local variables contain sensitive information, such as passwords or encryption keys, skipping the initialization can lead to information leaks if the uninitialized memory is read by an attacker.
`Security vulnerabilities:` skipLocalsInit=true can introduce security vulnerabilities, such as buffer overflow attacks, which can occur if uninitialized memory is overwritten with data that is too large for the buffer.

`Maintenance issues`: If code is developed with skipLocalsInit=true in mind, it can be difficult to remove it later without breaking existing code. This can result in maintenance issues that can be time-consuming and expensive to fix.

It's important to note that skipLocalsInit is typically only used in performance-critical code, where the benefits of skipping initialization outweigh the risks. In general, it's recommended to leave skipLocalsInit set to its default value of false unless there is a compelling reason to change it.
