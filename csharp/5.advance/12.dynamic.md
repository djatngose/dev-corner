# dynamic binding
Dynamic binding defers binding—the process of resolving types, members, and operators—from compile time to runtime. Dynamic binding is useful when at compile time you know that a certain function, member, or operation exists, but the compiler does not. This commonly occurs when you are interoperating with dynamic languages (such as IronPython) and COM as well as for scenarios in which you might otherwise use reflection.
A dynamic type is declared with the contextual keyword dynamic:
```c#
dynamic d = GetSomeObject();
d.Quack();
```
A dynamic type tells the compiler to relax. We expect the runtime type of d to have a Quack method. We just can’t prove it statically. Because d is dynamic, the compiler defers binding Quack to d until runtime. To understand what this means requires distinguishing between static binding and dynamic binding.

# Static Binding Versus Dynamic Binding
The canonical binding example is mapping a name to a specific function when compiling an expression. To compile the following expression, the compiler needs to find the implementation of the method named Quack:

d.Quack();
Let’s suppose that the static type of d is Duck:

Duck d = ...
d.Quack();

Now let’s change the static type of d to object:

object d = ...
d.Quack();
Calling Quack gives us a compilation error, because although the value stored in d can contain a method called Quack, the compiler cannot know it, because the only information it has is the type of the variable, which in this case is object. But let’s now change the static type of d to dynamic:

dynamic d = ...
d.Quack();

A dynamic type is like object—it’s equally nondescriptive about a type. The difference is that it lets you use it in ways that aren’t known at compile time. A dynamic object binds at runtime based on its runtime type, not its compile-time type. When the compiler sees a dynamically bound expression (which in general is an expression that contains any value of type dynamic), it merely packages up the expression such that the binding can be done later at runtime.

At runtime, if a dynamic object implements IDynamicMetaObjectProvider, that interface is used to perform the binding. If not, binding occurs in almost the same way as it would have had the compiler known the dynamic object’s runtime type. These two alternatives are called `custom binding and language binding`.

# Custom Binding
Custom binding occurs when a dynamic object implements IDynamicMetaObjectProvider (IDMOP). Although you can implement IDMOP on types that you write in C#, and that is useful to do, the more common case is that you have acquired an IDMOP object from a dynamic language that is implemented in .NET on the Dynamic Language Runtime (DLR), such as IronPython or IronRuby. Objects from those languages implicitly implement IDMOP as a means by which to directly control the meanings of operations performed on them.
```c#
using System;
using System.Dynamic;

dynamic d = new Duck();
d.Quack();                  // Quack method was called
d.Waddle();                 // Waddle method was called

public class Duck : DynamicObject
{
  public override bool TryInvokeMember (
    InvokeMemberBinder binder, object[] args, out object result)
  {
    Console.WriteLine (binder.Name + " method was called");
    result = null;
    return true;
  }
}
```
The Duck class doesn’t actually have a Quack method. Instead, it uses custom binding to intercept and interpret all method calls.

# Language Binding
Language binding occurs when a dynamic object does not implement IDynamic​Me⁠taObjectProvider. It is useful when working around imperfectly designed types or inherent limitations in the .NET type system (we explore more scenarios in Chapter 19). A typical problem when using numeric types is that they have no common interface. We have seen that we can bind methods dynamically; the same is true for operators:

int x = 3, y = 4;
Console.WriteLine (Mean (x, y));

dynamic Mean (dynamic x, dynamic y) => (x + y) / 2;
The benefit is obvious—you don’t need to duplicate code for each numeric type. However, you lose static type safety, risking runtime exceptions rather than compile-time errors.

NOTE
Dynamic binding circumvents static type safety but not runtime type safety. Unlike with reflection (Chapter 18), you can’t circumvent member accessibility rules with dynamic binding.

By design, language runtime binding behaves as similarly as possible to static binding, had the runtime types of the dynamic objects been known at compile time. In our previous example, the behavior of our program would be identical if we hardcoded Mean to work with the int type. The most notable exception in parity between static and dynamic binding is for extension methods, which we discuss in “Uncallable Functions”.

NOTE
Dynamic binding also incurs a performance hit. Because of the DLR’s caching mechanisms, however, repeated calls to the same dynamic expression are optimized—allowing you to efficiently call dynamic expressions in a loop. This optimization brings the typical overhead for a simple dynamic expression on today’s hardware down to less than 100 ns.

# why Dynamic binding have a performance hit?
Dynamic binding has a performance hit because it involves resolving the method or property at runtime rather than at compile time. This means that the compiler cannot perform optimizations that it would normally do for statically typed code, such as inlining method calls, eliminating unnecessary checks, and so on.

Instead, the runtime has to perform additional work to locate the method or property at runtime, perform type checks, and handle any potential errors that may arise during the dynamic binding process. This additional work can result in slower performance compared to statically typed code that has already been optimized by the compiler.

Furthermore, dynamic binding also introduces a certain amount of overhead associated with the dynamic dispatch mechanism, which involves looking up the method to be called at runtime based on the actual type of the object being operated on. This can be particularly expensive when working with complex object hierarchies, where the type of an object may only be known at runtime.

# RuntimeBinderException
If a member fails to bind, a RuntimeBinderException is thrown. You can think of this like a compile-time error at runtime:

dynamic d = 5;
d.Hello();                  // throws RuntimeBinderException
The exception is thrown because the int type has no Hello method.

# When to use dynamic binding?

`Interacting with dynamic languages`: Dynamic languages like Python, Ruby, and JavaScript allow for late binding of methods and properties. If you want to interact with code written in these languages from C#, dynamic binding can be used to call the methods and properties dynamically.

`Working with COM objects`: COM (Component Object Model) is a technology that allows software components to communicate with each other. When working with COM objects in C#, dynamic binding can be used to call methods and properties that are not known at compile time.

`Parsing JSON or XML:` When parsing JSON or XML data, dynamic binding can be used to navigate the object hierarchy and extract the necessary data. Since the structure of JSON and XML data can be dynamic, dynamic binding can be useful in these scenarios.

Overall, dynamic binding can be a powerful tool when dealing with scenarios that involve dynamic types and data structures. However, it should be used with caution since it can have a performance impact and can make code harder to maintain.

# Runtime Representation of Dynamic
There is a deep equivalence between the dynamic and object types. The runtime treats the following expression as true:

typeof (dynamic) == typeof (object)
This principle extends to constructed types and array types:

typeof (List<dynamic>) == typeof (List<object>)
typeof (dynamic[]) == typeof (object[])
Like an object reference, a dynamic reference can point to an object of any type (except pointer types):

dynamic x = "hello";
Console.WriteLine (x.GetType().Name);  // String

x = 123;  // No error (despite same variable)
Console.WriteLine (x.GetType().Name);  // Int32
Structurally, there is no difference between an object reference and a dynamic reference. A dynamic reference simply enables dynamic operations on the object it points to. You can convert from object to dynamic to perform any dynamic operation you want on an object:

object o = new System.Text.StringBuilder();
dynamic d = o;
d.Append ("hello");
Console.WriteLine (o);   // hello

`NOTE`
Reflecting on a type exposing (public) dynamic members reveals that those members are represented as annotated objects; for example

public class Test
{
  public dynamic Foo;
}
is equivalent to:

public class Test
{
  [System.Runtime.CompilerServices.DynamicAttribute]
  public object Foo;
}
This allows consumers of that type to know that Foo should be treated as dynamic while allowing languages that don’t support dynamic binding to fall back to object.

# Dynamic Conversions
The dynamic type has implicit conversions to and from all other types:

```c#
int i = 7;
dynamic d = i; //boxing allocation:conversion int to dynamic required boxing of value type
long j = d;        // No cast required (implicit conversion)
```
For the conversion to succeed, the runtime type of the dynamic object must be implicitly convertible to the target static type. The preceding example worked because an int is implicitly convertible to a long.

The following example throws a RuntimeBinderException because an int is not implicitly convertible to a short:
```c#
int i = 7;
dynamic d = i;
short j = d;      // throws RuntimeBinderException
```

# Dynamic Conversions whether got boxing and unboxing or not?
Yes, dynamic conversions can result in boxing and unboxing. When you use dynamic binding to convert a value of a certain type to another type, the runtime creates an instance of the new type and copies the value of the original object to the new object. If the original value is a value type (e.g., an integer), the runtime boxes the value to create a reference type (e.g., an object) to hold the value. This boxing and unboxing can add performance overhead to your code.

# var vs dynamic
The var and dynamic types bear a superficial resemblance, but the difference is deep:

`var` says, “Let the compiler figure out the type.”

`dynamic` says, “Let the runtime figure out the type.”

To illustrate:
```c#
dynamic x = "hello";  // Static type is dynamic; runtime type is string
var y = "hello";      // Static type is string; runtime type is string
int i = x;            // Runtime error      (cannot convert string to int)
int j = y;            // Compile-time error (cannot convert string to int)
```
The static type of a variable declared with var can be dynamic:
```c#
dynamic x = "hello";
var y = x;            // Static type of y is dynamic
int z = y;            // Runtime error (cannot convert string to int)
```

# Dynamic Expressions
Fields, properties, methods, events, constructors, indexers, operators, and conversions can all be called dynamically.

Trying to consume the result of a `dynamic expression with a void return type is prohibited`—just as with a statically typed expression. The difference is that the error occurs at runtime:

dynamic list = new List<int>();
var result = list.Add (5);         // RuntimeBinderException thrown
Expressions involving dynamic `operands` are typically themselves dynamic because the effect of absent type information is cascading:

dynamic x = 2;
var y = x * 3;       // Static type of y is dynamic
There are a couple of obvious exceptions to this rule. First,` casting a dynamic expression` to a static type yields a static expression:

dynamic x = 2;
var y = (int)x;      // Static type of y is int
Second, constructor invocations always yield static expressions—even when called with dynamic arguments. In this example, x is statically typed to a StringBuilder:

dynamic capacity = 10;
var x = new System.Text.StringBuilder (capacity);
In addition, there are a few edge cases for which an expression containing a dynamic argument is static, including passing an index to an array and delegate creation expressions.

# Dynamic Calls Without Dynamic Receivers
The canonical use case for dynamic involves a dynamic receiver. This means that a dynamic object is the receiver of a dynamic function call:

dynamic x = ...;
x.Foo();          // x is the receiver
However, you can also call statically known functions with dynamic arguments. Such calls are subject to dynamic overload resolution and can include the following:

Static methods

Instance constructors

Instance methods on receivers with a statically known type

In the following example, the particular Foo that gets dynamically bound is dependent on the runtime type of the dynamic argument:

class Program
{
  static void Foo (int x)    => Console.WriteLine ("int");
  static void Foo (string x) => Console.WriteLine ("string");

  static void Main()
  {
    dynamic x = 5;
    dynamic y = "watermelon";

    Foo (x);    // int
    Foo (y);    // string
  }
}
Because a dynamic receiver is not involved, the compiler can statically perform a basic check to see whether the dynamic call will succeed. It checks whether a function with the correct name and number of parameters exists. If no candidate is found, you get a compile-time error:

class Program
{
  static void Foo (int x)    => Console.WriteLine ("int");
  static void Foo (string x) => Console.WriteLine ("string");

  static void Main()
  {
    dynamic x = 5;
    Foo (x, x);        // Compiler error - wrong number of parameters
    Fook (x);          // Compiler error - no such method name
  }
}

# Static Types in Dynamic Expressions
It’s obvious that dynamic types are used in dynamic binding. It’s not so obvious that static types are also used—wherever possible—in dynamic binding. Consider the following:

class Program
{
  static void Foo (object x, object y) { Console.WriteLine ("oo"); }
  static void Foo (object x, string y) { Console.WriteLine ("os"); }
  static void Foo (string x, object y) { Console.WriteLine ("so"); }
  static void Foo (string x, string y) { Console.WriteLine ("ss"); }

  static void Main()
  {
    object o = "hello";
    dynamic d = "goodbye";
    Foo (o, d);               // os
  }
}
The call to Foo (o,d) is dynamically bound because one of its arguments, d, is dynamic. But because o is statically known, the binding—even though it occurs dynamically—will make use of that. In this case, overload resolution will pick the second implementation of Foo due to the static type of o and the runtime type of d. In other words, the compiler is “as static as it can possibly be.”

# Uncallable Functions
Some functions cannot be called dynamically. You cannot call the following:

Extension methods (via extension method syntax)
```c#
using System;

public static class ExtensionMethods {
    public static void SayHello(this string str) {
        Console.WriteLine("Hello " + str);
    }
}

public class Program {
    static void Main() {
        dynamic name = "John";
        name.SayHello(); // This will not work as extension methods cannot be called dynamically.
    }
}
```

Members of an interface, if you need to cast to that interface to do so

Base members hidden by a subclass
```c#
using System;

class Animal {
    public void Speak() {
        Console.WriteLine("Animal speaking");
    }
}

class Dog : Animal {
    public new void Speak() {
        Console.WriteLine("Dog barking");
    }
}

class Program {
    static void Main(string[] args) {
        dynamic dog = new Dog();
        dog.Speak(); // This will not work as base members hidden by a subclass cannot be called dynamically.
    }
}
```
Understanding why this is so is useful in understanding dynamic binding.

Dynamic binding requires two pieces of information: the name of the function to call and the object upon which to call the function. However, in each of the three uncallable scenarios, an additional type is involved, which is known only at compile time. As of this writing, there’s no way to specify these additional types dynamically.

When calling extension methods, that additional type is implicit. It’s the static class on which the extension method is defined. The compiler searches for it given the using directives in your source code. This makes extension methods compile-time-only concepts because using directives melt away upon compilation (after they’ve done their job in the binding process in mapping simple names to namespace-qualified names).

When calling members via an interface, you specify that additional type via an implicit or explicit cast. There are two scenarios for which you might want to do this: when calling explicitly implemented interface members and when calling interface members implemented in a type internal to another assembly. We can illustrate the former with the following two types:

interface IFoo   { void Test();        }
class Foo : IFoo { void IFoo.Test() {} }
To call the Test method, we must cast to the IFoo interface. This is easy with static typing:

IFoo f = new Foo();   // Implicit cast to interface
f.Test();
Now consider the situation with dynamic typing:

IFoo f = new Foo();
dynamic d = f;
d.Test();             // Exception thrown
The implicit cast shown in bold tells the compiler to bind subsequent member calls on f to IFoo rather than Foo—in other words, to view that object through the lens of the IFoo interface. However, that lens is lost at runtime, so the DLR cannot complete the binding. The loss is illustrated as follows:

Console.WriteLine (f.GetType().Name);    // Foo
A similar situation arises when calling a hidden base member: you must specify an additional type via either a cast or the base keyword—and that additional type is lost at runtime.

NOTE
Should you need to invoke interface members dynamically, a workaround is to use the Uncapsulator open source library, available on NuGet and GitHub. Uncapsulator was written by the author to address this problem, and leverages custom binding to provide a better dynamic than dynamic:

IFoo f = new Foo();
dynamic uf = f.Uncapsulate();
uf.Test();
Uncapsulator also lets you cast to base types and interfaces by name, dynamically call static members, and access nonpublic members of a type.
