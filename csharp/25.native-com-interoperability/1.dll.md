# Calling into Native DLLs
P/Invoke, short for Platform Invocation Services, allows you to access functions, structs, and callbacks in unmanaged DLLs (shared libraries on Unix).
For example, consider the MessageBox function, defined in the Windows DLL user32.dll, as follows:
    int MessageBox (HWND hWnd, LPCTSTR lpText, LPCTSTR lpCaption, UINT uType);
You can call this function directly by declaring a static method of the same name, applying the extern keyword, and adding the DllImport attribute:
    using System;
    using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
    MessageBox (IntPtr.Zero,
                "Please do not press this again.", "Attention", 0);
    [DllImport("user32.dll")]
    static extern int MessageBox (IntPtr hWnd, string text, string caption,
int type);
The MessageBox classes in the System.Windows and System.Windows.Forms name‐ spaces themselves call similar unmanaged methods.


Here’s a DllImport example for Ubuntu Linux: Console.WriteLine ($"User ID: {getuid()}");
[DllImport("libc")]
static extern uint getuid();
The CLR includes a marshaler that knows how to convert parameters and return values between .NET types and unmanaged types. In the Windows example, the int parameters translate directly to four-byte integers that the function expects, and the string parameters are converted into null-terminated arrays of Unicode characters (encoded in UTF-16). IntPtr is a struct designed to encapsulate an unmanaged handle; it’s 32 bits wide on 32-bit platforms and 64 bits wide on 64-bit platforms. A similar translation happens on Unix. (From C# 9, you can also use the nint type, which maps to IntPtr.)
