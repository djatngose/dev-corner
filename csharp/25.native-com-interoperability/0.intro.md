# Native com inteoperability

This chapter describes how to integrate with native `(unmanaged) Dynamic-Link Libraries (DLLs)` and `Component Object Model (COM) components`. Unless other‚Äê wise stated, the types mentioned in this chapter exist in either the System or the System.Runtime.InteropServices namespace.

(Unmanaged) `Dynamic-Link Libraries (DLLs)` and `Component Object Model (COM)` components are technologies used in `Windows operating system development`.

# DLLs
DLLs are `libraries of executable code that can be loaded and executed by a program at runtime`. They are commonly used to implement code that is shared by multiple applications or to enable modularity and extensibility within an application. DLLs are compiled as native code and, as the name implies, are loaded dynamically at runtime, rather than being linked statically at compile-time.

# COM
`COM`, on the other hand, is a `binary interface standard for software components developed by Microsoft`. `COM` components are binary units of code that expose a standard interface for other software to use. They can be developed in any programming language that supports the COM standard, and can be used by other programs regardless of the language they were written in.

Both `DLLs` and `COM` components are written in `native code`, meaning they are `unmanaged and compiled to run directly on the processor`. This is in contrast to managed code, which runs in a virtual machine like the .NET CLR.

# When to use?
`COM` (Component Object Model) is a binary interface standard used for inter-process communication and component-based development.

Here are some scenarios where you might use native COM interoperability in C#:

`Working with legacy systems`: If you have a legacy system or a third-party library that exposes a COM interface, you can use native COM interoperability to access and use its functionality from your C# application.

`Office automation`: Microsoft Office applications, such as Excel, Word, and Outlook, expose COM interfaces that allow you to automate tasks and manipulate documents. You can use native COM interoperability in C# to interact with these applications and perform operations like reading/writing data, generating reports, or sending emails.

`Accessing system services:` Some operating system features and services provide COM interfaces for programmatic access. For example, the Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI) service provides a COM interface that allows you to manage system resources, query information, and perform administrative tasks.

`Third-party components`: There might be third-party components or libraries in the form of COM objects that provide specific functionality that you want to use in your C# application. By using native COM interoperability, you can create C# wrappers or proxies to interact with these components.

`When using native COM interoperability in C#, it's important to consider the following:`

COM interop introduces an extra layer of complexity and potential performance overhead, so it's generally recommended to use it only when necessary.
It's advisable to encapsulate the COM interop code within a separate class or module to isolate it from the rest of your C# codebase.
Proper error handling and resource management are crucial when working with COM objects to prevent memory leaks and ensure graceful cleanup.
In recent years, with the rise of .NET Core and the focus on cross-platform development, the usage of native COM interoperability has diminished as newer frameworks and technologies provide alternative solutions for similar functionalities.

# Alternative solutions
In .NET Core, there are alternative solutions available for similar functionalities that reduce the reliance on native COM interoperability. Here are some options:

`Platform-specific libraries`: .NET Core supports platform-specific libraries, which allow you to write platform-specific code directly in your .NET Core application. This approach enables you to leverage platform-specific APIs and functionalities without using COM interop. You can define platform-specific implementations for different operating systems (such as Windows, macOS, or Linux) and use them directly in your code.

`Managed libraries and NuGet packages`: Instead of relying on COM components, you can look for managed libraries or NuGet packages that provide similar functionality. These libraries are designed specifically for .NET Core and provide cross-platform support. You can search for libraries in the NuGet Gallery (https://www.nuget.org/) or other package repositories based on your specific requirements.

`Cross-platform APIs and frameworks`: With the evolution of .NET Core, many cross-platform APIs and frameworks have emerged that provide functionalities comparable to traditional COM components. For example, the Office Open XML SDK allows you to work with Microsoft Office file formats (such as Word, Excel, and PowerPoint) without requiring COM interop. Similarly, libraries like EPPlus and NPOI provide functionality for reading and writing Excel files directly in .NET Core applications.

`Web APIs and services`: If the functionality you require can be exposed through a web API or service, you can consume it directly from your .NET Core application using HTTP requests and RESTful communication. This approach eliminates the need for COM interop entirely and allows for easy integration with various systems and platforms.

`.NET Core-specific libraries and features`: .NET Core offers its own set of libraries and features that provide functionality similar to some COM components. For example, the System.IO.Ports namespace in .NET Core allows you to work with serial ports for communication, and the System.Diagnostics.Process class provides ways to interact with processes and execute commands.
