# Native com inteoperability

This chapter describes how to integrate with native `(unmanaged) Dynamic-Link Libraries (DLLs)` and `Component Object Model (COM) components`. Unless other‚Äê wise stated, the types mentioned in this chapter exist in either the System or the System.Runtime.InteropServices namespace.

(Unmanaged) `Dynamic-Link Libraries (DLLs)` and `Component Object Model (COM)` components are technologies used in `Windows operating system development`.

# DLLs
DLLs are `libraries of executable code that can be loaded and executed by a program at runtime`. They are commonly used to implement code that is shared by multiple applications or to enable modularity and extensibility within an application. DLLs are compiled as native code and, as the name implies, are loaded dynamically at runtime, rather than being linked statically at compile-time.

# COM
`COM`, on the other hand, is a `binary interface standard for software components developed by Microsoft`. `COM` components are binary units of code that expose a standard interface for other software to use. They can be developed in any programming language that supports the COM standard, and can be used by other programs regardless of the language they were written in.

Both `DLLs` and `COM` components are written in `native code`, meaning they are `unmanaged and compiled to run directly on the processor`. This is in contrast to managed code, which runs in a virtual machine like the .NET CLR.
