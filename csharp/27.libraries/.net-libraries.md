# AsyncEx
AsyncEx is a library that provides several helpful utilities and extension methods for asynchronous programming in .NET. It was created to simplify common scenarios encountered when working with asynchronous code, and to provide a more natural and expressive API for asynchronous programming.

The AsyncEx library provides several classes and extension methods that make it easier to work with asynchronous operations. Some of its key features include:

AsyncLock - an asynchronous lock that can be used to serialize access to a shared resource in a multi-threaded environment.

AsyncManualResetEvent - an asynchronous version of the ManualResetEvent class that can be used to synchronize asynchronous operations.

AsyncSemaphore - an asynchronous version of the Semaphore class that can be used to limit the number of concurrent asynchronous operations.

AsyncProducerConsumerQueue - an asynchronous queue that can be used to implement producer-consumer scenarios.

Extension methods for asynchronous programming - the AsyncEx library provides extension methods for Task, TaskCompletionSource, and other asynchronous types to simplify common asynchronous programming scenarios.

AsyncEx is available as a NuGet package and supports .NET Standard 2.0, .NET Framework 4.5, and higher versions of .NET. Overall, AsyncEx is a useful library for developers who work with asynchronous code in .NET and want to simplify common scenarios encountered in asynchronous programming.

# Humanizer
Humanizer meets all your .NET needs for manipulating and displaying strings, enums, dates, times, timespans, numbers and quantities. It is part of the .NET Foundation
```json
"PascalCaseInputStringIsTurnedIntoSentence".Humanize() => "Pascal case input string is turned into sentence"

"Underscored_input_string_is_turned_into_sentence".Humanize() => "Underscored input string is turned into sentence"

"Underscored_input_String_is_turned_INTO_sentence".Humanize() => "Underscored input String is turned INTO sentence"

// acronyms are left intact
"HTML".Humanize() => "HTML"

// any unbroken upper case string is treated as an acronym
"HUMANIZER".Humanize() => "HUMANIZER"
"HUMANIZER".Transform(To.LowerCase, To.TitleCase) => "Humanizer"

"CanReturnTitleCase".Humanize(LetterCasing.Title) => "Can Return Title Case"

"Can_return_title_Case".Humanize(LetterCasing.Title) => "Can Return Title Case"

"CanReturnLowerCase".Humanize(LetterCasing.LowerCase) => "can return lower case"

"CanHumanizeIntoUpperCase".Humanize(LetterCasing.AllCaps) => "CAN HUMANIZE INTO UPPER CASE"

"Sentence casing".Transform(To.LowerCase) => "sentence casing"
"Sentence casing".Transform(To.SentenceCase) => "Sentence casing"
"Sentence casing".Transform(To.TitleCase) => "Sentence Casing"
"Sentence casing".Transform(To.UpperCase) => "SENTENCE CASING"
```

```c#
public enum EnumUnderTest
{
    [Description("Custom description")]
    MemberWithDescriptionAttribute,
    MemberWithoutDescriptionAttribute,
    ALLCAPITALS
}

// DescriptionAttribute is honored
EnumUnderTest.MemberWithDescriptionAttribute.Humanize() => "Custom description"

// In the absence of Description attribute string.Humanizer kicks in
EnumUnderTest.MemberWithoutDescriptionAttribute.Humanize() => "Member without description attribute"

// Of course you can still apply letter casing
EnumUnderTest.MemberWithoutDescriptionAttribute.Humanize().Transform(To.TitleCase) => "Member Without Description Attribute"
```

TImeSpan
```c#
TimeSpan.FromDays(1).Humanize(precision:2) => "1 day" // no difference when there is only one unit in the provided TimeSpan
TimeSpan.FromDays(16).Humanize(2) => "2 weeks, 2 days"

// the same TimeSpan value with different precision returns different results
TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(1299630020).Humanize() => "2 weeks"
TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(1299630020).Humanize(3) => "2 weeks, 1 day, 1 hour"
TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(1299630020).Humanize(4) => "2 weeks, 1 day, 1 hour, 30 seconds"
TimeSpan.FromMilliseconds(1299630020).Humanize(5) => "2 weeks, 1 day, 1 hour, 30 seconds, 20 milliseconds"

# System.Net.NameResolution
System.Net.NameResolution is a .NET namespace that provides classes for resolving domain names to IP addresses and vice versa. The namespace contains classes such as Dns, which provides methods for resolving domain names, and IPHostEntry, which represents a host entry on a Domain Name System (DNS) server.

The System.Net.NameResolution namespace is part of the System.Net assembly, which is included in the .NET Framework and .NET Core. Here are some of the key classes provided by the namespace:

Dns - Provides methods for resolving domain names to IP addresses and IP addresses to domain names.

IPHostEntry - Represents a host entry on a DNS server, which contains information about the host's IP addresses, aliases, and more.

IPAddress - Represents an IP address, which can be either an IPv4 address or an IPv6 address.

IPEndPoint - Represents an endpoint as an IP address and a port number.


The System.Net.NameResolution namespace is particularly useful for network programming, where it is often necessary to resolve domain names to IP addresses and vice versa. For example, it can be used to establish connections to remote servers or to check the availability of network resources.

Resolving a domain name to an IP address:
```c#
string hostname = "www.example.com";
IPAddress[] addresses = Dns.GetHostAddresses(hostname);
foreach (IPAddress address in addresses)
{
    Console.WriteLine(address);
}
```
This code uses the Dns class to resolve the hostname "www.example.com" to an array of IP addresses, and then loops through the addresses and prints them to the console.

Resolving an IP address to a host name:
```c#
IPAddress ipAddress = IPAddress.Parse("192.168.1.1");
IPHostEntry hostEntry = Dns.GetHostEntry(ipAddress);
Console.WriteLine(hostEntry.HostName);
```
This code uses the Dns class to resolve the IP address "192.168.1.1" to a host entry, and then prints the host name to the console.

Creating an endpoint from an IP address and port number:
```c#
IPAddress ipAddress = IPAddress.Parse("192.168.1.1");
int port = 80;
IPEndPoint endpoint = new IPEndPoint(ipAddress, port);
Console.WriteLine(endpoint.ToString());
```
This code creates an IPEndPoint object from the IP address "192.168.1.1" and port number 80, and then prints the endpoint to the console.

Overall, the System.Net.NameResolution namespace provides useful classes and methods for resolving domain names to IP addresses and vice versa, which can be used in various network programming scenarios.
