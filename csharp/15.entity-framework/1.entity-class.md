# EF Core Entity Classes
EF Core lets you use any class to represent data, as long as it contains a public property for each column that you want to query.

For instance, we could define the following entity class to query and update a Customers table in the database:
```c#
public class Customer
{
  public int ID { get; set; } 
  public string Name { get; set; }
}
````
