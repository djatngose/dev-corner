# Here are some common optimization solutions for EF Core in real-life scenarios:

# Use `NoTracking` queries when reading large amounts of data that do not need to be updated.
# Use `asynchronous operations` when working with EF Core to improve performance and scalability.
# Use `SQL Server Query Store` to monitor and optimize query performance.
It captures a history of query execution plans and run-time statistics, allowing database administrators and developers to easily identify and diagnose performance problems caused by plan changes, parameter sniffing, and other factors.

The Query Store can be used to monitor query performance, identify regressions, force specific query plans, and more. It can also be integrated with other tools, such as `SQL Server Management Studio and SQL Server Profiler`, to provide even more detailed analysis and troubleshooting capabilities.
# Use `database indexe`s to improve query performance and reduce the amount of data that needs to be retrieved.
# Use `lazy loading` selectively to reduce the amount of data that needs to be retrieved from the database.
# Use `projections` to retrieve only the data that is needed for a specific operation.
a projection is a way to retrieve only a subset of data from the database rather than the entire entity. It is a technique to improve performance and reduce the amount of data transferred between the database and the application.

`Projections can be achieved in EF Core using a Select method in a LINQ query`, which allows you to specify the specific columns or properties you want to retrieve. For example:
```c#
var results = dbContext.Customers
    .Where(c => c.Name.StartsWith("A"))
    .Select(c => new { c.Name, c.Email })
    .ToList();
```
In this example, we're retrieving only the Name and Email properties of Customer entities where the Name starts with "A". The resulting SQL query will only retrieve those two columns from the database rather than the entire Customer entity, which can lead to significant performance improvements when dealing with large datasets.

Projections can also be used with aggregate functions like Sum, Count, and Max to retrieve summarized data from the database.
# Use `compiled queries` to improve query performance.
In EF Core, a compiled query is a way to pre-compile a LINQ query into a database-specific representation that can be executed more efficiently than parsing and compiling the query every time it is executed.

When a query is compiled, it is translated into an expression tree that is passed to the Compile method of the Entity Framework's QueryCompiler class. This method generates a delegate that can be cached and reused, avoiding the overhead of recompiling the query every time it is executed.

Compiled queries can significantly improve the performance of frequently used queries, especially when dealing with large datasets. However, they also add some overhead in terms of memory usage and initial startup time, as the queries need to be compiled before they can be executed.

To use compiled queries in EF Core, you can use the QueryHelpers class and the CompileQuery method to compile the query and obtain a delegate that can be cached and reused.
```c#
using System;
using System.Linq;
using System.Linq.Expressions;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore;
using Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Query;

public class NutshellContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<Customer> Customers { get; set; }

    protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
    {
        optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer("Server=localhost;Database=MyDatabase;Trusted_Connection=True;");
    }

    public static Func<NutshellContext, string, IQueryable<Customer>> GetCustomersByName =
        EF.CompileQuery((NutshellContext context, string name) =>
            context.Customers.Where(c => c.Name == name));
}

public class Customer
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
}

```
In this example, we've defined a compiled query named GetCustomersByName that takes a NutshellContext and a string as parameters and returns an IQueryable<Customer> filtered by the specified name. We've used the EF.CompileQuery method to compile the query into a delegate that can be executed against the context without recompiling the expression tree every time.

We can then use the compiled query in our code like this:
```c#
using (var dbContext = new NutshellContext())
{
    var customers = NutshellContext.GetCustomersByName(dbContext, "Alice").ToList();
    foreach (var customer in customers)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(customer.Name);
    }
}

```
In this code, we're calling the GetCustomersByName delegate with our NutshellContext and the name we want to filter by. The compiled query is executed against the context to retrieve the filtered customers, and we can iterate over the results and print out their names.

Using compiled queries can improve performance by reducing the overhead of query compilation and expression tree generation, especially for complex queries that are executed frequently.

# Use `change tracking optimization` techniques, such as implementing `INotifyPropertyChanged` and INotifyPropertyChanging in your entities, to improve performance and reduce memory usage.
# Use `connection resiliency` to handle transient errors when working with EF Core.
Connection resiliency is a feature in EF Core that allows it to automatically retry failed database operations, such as transient errors, connection timeouts, and deadlocks. This helps to improve the reliability and availability of the application by reducing the number of errors and downtime caused by these issues.

When connection resiliency is enabled, EF Core will attempt to reconnect to the database and retry the failed operation a specified number of times with a delay between each attempt. If the operation is still unsuccessful after the maximum number of retries has been reached, an exception is thrown.

To enable connection resiliency in EF Core, you can use the UseSqlServer method when configuring the database provider in the DbContext class, and set the EnableRetryOnFailure method to true, like this:

```c#
services.AddDbContext<MyDbContext>(options =>
    options.UseSqlServer(connectionString,
        sqlServerOptions => sqlServerOptions.EnableRetryOnFailure()));
```
By default, EF Core will retry the failed operation up to 5 times with a delay of 0.5 seconds between each attempt. You can customize these values by using the MaxRetryCount and MaxRetryDelay methods, like this:

```c#
services.AddDbContext<MyDbContext>(options =>
    options.UseSqlServer(connectionString,
        sqlServerOptions =>
            sqlServerOptions.EnableRetryOnFailure(
                maxRetryCount: 10,
                maxRetryDelay: TimeSpan.FromSeconds(30),
                errorNumbersToAdd: null)));
```
In this example, EF Core will retry the failed operation up to 10 times with a delay of 30 seconds between each attempt, and it will retry for all error codes by default.
# Use `the Entity Framework Profiler tool` to identify and resolve performance issues in your EF Core code.
Entity Framework Profiler is a tool that provides detailed insight into the performance of Entity Framework code by monitoring the database queries and commands executed by EF. It can help identify potential performance issues and provide recommendations for optimizing queries and improving overall performance.

The tool captures all database queries and commands executed by EF, including parameter values and execution time, and presents this information in a user-friendly interface. It also provides profiling features such as real-time monitoring, query optimization recommendations, and code-level profiling.

Entity Framework Profiler can be used to optimize Entity Framework applications in various ways, such as identifying and resolving N+1 query issues, reducing unnecessary database roundtrips, and identifying slow-running queries. It can be particularly useful in large applications where database performance can have a significant impact on overall application performance.
