# DbContext
After defining entity classes, the next step is to subclass DbContext. An instance of that class represents your sessions working with the database. Typically, your DbContext subclass will contain one DbSet<T> property for each entity in your model:

public class NutshellContext : DbContext
{
  public DbSet<Customer> Customers { get; set; }
  ... properties for other tables ...

}
A `DbContext` object does three things:
  - It acts as a `factory for generating DbSet<> objects that you can query`.
  - It `keeps track of any changes that you make to your entities` so that you can write them back (see “Change Tracking”).
  - It provides `virtual methods that you can override to configure the connection and model.`
# Why we need DbContext in EF?
he DbContext class in Entity Framework (EF) is a fundamental part of the EF API. It represents a session with the database, allowing you to query, insert, update, and delete data from the database.

Here are some reasons why we need DbContext in EF:

`Represents a session with the database`: The DbContext class represents a session with the database and provides a way to interact with the database. It allows you to query the database, insert, update, and delete data, and manage transactions.

`Mapping between the database and the object model`: The DbContext class provides a mapping between the database and the object model. It allows you to define entities and their relationships, and maps them to tables and columns in the database.

`Change tracking:` The DbContext class tracks changes made to entities, including new entities, modified entities, and deleted entities. It can also generate SQL statements to update the database with the changes.

`Caching`: The DbContext class can cache data retrieved from the database, reducing the number of roundtrips to the database and improving performance.

`Lazy loading`: The DbContext class can lazy-load related entities, meaning that it only loads related entities when they are accessed for the first time.
# when DbContext cache data?
The DbContext class in Entity Framework caches data retrieved from the database by default. This caching can improve performance by reducing the number of roundtrips to the database.

Here are some details on when DbContext caches data:

`First query`: When you execute a query against the DbContext for the first time, the data is retrieved from the database and cached in memory.

`Subsequent queries`: If you execute the same query against the DbContext again, the data is retrieved from the cache instead of the database. This can improve performance by avoiding a roundtrip to the database.

`Change tracking`: The DbContext class tracks changes made to entities, including new entities, modified entities, and deleted entities. It can also generate SQL statements to update the database with the changes. These changes are cached in memory until they are saved to the database.

`Explicit loading`: You can use the DbContext to explicitly load related entities. When you do this, the related entities are retrieved from the database and cached in memory.

It's important to note that the caching behavior of the DbContext can be configured or disabled if needed. For example, you can disable change tracking, disable lazy loading, or configure caching to expire after a certain amount of time.

# Configuring the connection
By overriding the OnConfiguring method, you can specify the database provider and connection string:

public class NutshellContext : DbContext
{
  ...
  protected override void OnConfiguring (DbContextOptionsBuilder 
                                         optionsBuilder) =>
    optionsBuilder.UseSqlServer 
      (@"Server=(local);Database=Nutshell;Trusted_Connection=True");
}
In this example, the connection string is specified as a string literal. Production applications would typically retrieve it from a configuration file such as appsettings.json.

UseSqlServer is an extension method defined in an assembly that’s part of the Microsoft.EntityFramework.SqlServer NuGet package. Packages are available for other database providers, including Oracle, MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.

`NOTE`
If you’re using ASP.NET, you can allow its dependency injection framework to preconfigure optionsBuilder; in most cases, this lets you avoid overriding OnConfiguring altogether. To enable this, define a constructor on DbContext as follows:

public NutshellContext (DbContextOptions<NutshellContext>
                        options)
  : base(options) { }
If you do choose to override OnConfiguring (perhaps to provide a configuration if your DbContext is used in another scenario), you can check whether options have already been configured as follows:

protected override void OnConfiguring (
  DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
{
  if (!optionsBuilder.IsConfigured)
  {
    ...
  }
}

# Configuring the Model
By default, EF Core is convention based, meaning that it infers the database schema from your class and property names.

You can override the defaults using the fluent api by overriding OnModelCreating and calling extension methods on the ModelBuilder parameter. For example, we can explicitly specify the database table name for our Customer entity as follows:
```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating (ModelBuilder modelBuilder) =>
  modelBuilder.Entity<Customer>()
    .ToTable ("Customer");   // Table is called 'Customer'
```
Without this code, EF Core would map this entity to a table named “Customers” rather than “Customer”, because we have a DbSet<Customer> property in our DbContext called Customers:
```c#
public DbSet<Customer> Customers { get; set; }
```
`NOTE`
The following code maps all of your entities to table names that match the entity class name (which is typically singular) rather than the DbSet<T> property name (which is typically plural):
```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating (ModelBuilder
                                        modelBuilder)
{
  foreach (IMutableEntityType entityType in
           modelBuilder.Model.GetEntityTypes())
  {
    modelBuilder.Entity (entityType.Name)
      .ToTable (entityType.ClrType.Name);
  }
}
```
The fluent API offers an expanded syntax for configuring columns. In the next example, we use two popular methods:

HasColumnName, which maps a property to a differently named column

IsRequired, which indicates that a column is not nullable
```c#
protected override void OnModelCreating (ModelBuilder modelBuilder) =>
  modelBuilder.Entity<Customer> (entity =>
  {
      entity.ToTable ("Customer");
      entity.Property (e => e.Name)
            .HasColumnName ("Full Name")  // Column name is 'Full Name'
            .IsRequired();                // Column is not nullable
  });
```

```
Method	Purpose	Example
ToTable	Specify the database table name for a given entity	
builder
  .Entity<Customer>()
  .ToTable("Customer");
HasColumnName	Specify the column name for a given property	
builder.Entity<Customer>()
  .Property(c => c.Name)
  .HasColumnName("Full Name");
HasKey	Specify a key (usually that deviates from convention)	
builder.Entity<Customer>()
  .HasKey(c => c.CustomerNr);
IsRequired	Specify that the property requires a value (is not nullable)	
builder.Entity<Customer>()
  .Property(c => c.Name)
  .IsRequired();
HasMaxLength	Specify the maximum length of a variable-length type (usually a string) whose width can vary	
builder.Entity<Customer>()
  .Property(c => c.Name)
  .HasMaxLength(60);
HasColumnType	Specify the database data type for a column	
builder.Entity<Purchase>()
  .Property(p => p.Description)
  .HasColumnType("varchar(80)");
Ignore	Ignore a type	
builder.Ignore<Products>();
Ignore	Ignore a property of a type	
builder.Entity<Customer>()
  .Ignore(c => c.ChatName);
HasIndex	Specify a property (or combination of properties) should serve in the database as an index	
// Compound index:
builder.Entity<Purchase>()
  .HasIndex(p =>
     new { p.Date, p.Price });

// Unique index on one property
builder
  .Entity<MedicalArticle>()
  .HasIndex(a => a.Topic)
  .IsUnique();
HasOne	See “Navigation Properties”	
builder.Entity<Purchase>()
  .HasOne(p => p.Customer)
  .WithMany(c => c.Purchases);
HasMany	See “Navigation Properties”	
builder.Entity<Customer>()
  .HasMany(c => c.Purchases)
  .WithOne(p => p.Customer);
```

# Creating the database
EF Core supports a code-first approach, which means that you can start by defining entity classes and then ask EF Core to create the database. The easiest way to do the latter is to call the following method on a DbContext instance:
```c#
dbContext.Database.EnsureCreated();
```

A better approach, however, is to use EF Core’s migrations feature, which not only creates the database but configures it such that EF Core can automatically update the schema in the future when your entity classes change. You can enable migrations in Visual Studio’s Package Manager Console and ask it to create the database with the following commands:
```c#
Install-Package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Tools
Add-Migration InitialCreate
Update-Database
```
The first command installs tools to manage EF Core from within Visual Studio. The second command generates a special C# class known as a code migration that contains instructions to create the database. The final command runs those instructions against the database connection string specified in the project’s application configuration file.
# Using DbContext
After you’ve defined Entity classes and subclassed DbContext, you can instantiate your DbContext and query the database, as follows:

using var dbContext = new NutshellContext();
Console.WriteLine (dbContext.Customers.Count());
// Executes "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM [Customer] AS [c]"
You can also use your DbContext instance to write to the database. The following code inserts a row into the Customer table:

using var dbContext = new NutshellContext();
Customer cust = new Customer()
{
  Name = "Sara Wells"
};
dbContext.Customers.Add (cust);
dbContext.SaveChanges();    // Writes changes back to database
The following queries the database for the customer that was just inserted:

using var dbContext = new NutshellContext();
Customer cust = dbContext.Customers
  .Single (c => c.Name == "Sara Wells")
The following updates that customer’s name and writes the change to the database:

cust.Name = "Dr. Sara Wells";
dbContext.SaveChanges();
`NOTE`
The Single operator is ideal for retrieving a row by primary key. Unlike First, it throws an exception if more than one element is returned.



# What scenarios what context is long-lived ?
In EF Core, a context can be considered long-lived if it is created once and used for multiple requests or user interactions. This is typical in desktop applications or server-side applications that handle multiple requests over a period of time.

Some scenarios where you might use a long-lived context include:

Desktop applications: In a desktop application, you might create a single context when the application starts up and use it for the duration of the application's lifetime. This can be more efficient than creating a new context for every user interaction.

Server-side applications: In a server-side application (such as a web application or API), you might use dependency injection to create a context that is scoped to the request. This context can be used to handle multiple requests within the same scope, improving performance by avoiding the overhead of creating a new context for every request.

Background tasks: In a background task or service, you might create a context when the task starts and use it for the duration of the task. This can be more efficient than creating a new context for every operation.

It's important to note that using a long-lived context can also introduce some challenges, such as the risk of data inconsistency or the need to handle concurrency conflicts. It's important to carefully consider the requirements of your application and choose an appropriate lifetime for the context.


#  services.AddDbContext is registered as scope or singleton?
When you call services.AddDbContext<MyDbContext>(...) in the ConfigureServices method of your Startup class, it registers a DbContext instance with the dependency injection (DI) container.

By default, the DbContext instance is registered with a "scoped" lifetime, meaning that a new instance of the DbContext will be created for each HTTP request processed by your application. This is generally the most appropriate lifetime for a DbContext instance in a web application, as it ensures that the instance is disposed of properly at the end of each request.

Here's the relevant documentation from Microsoft:

When registering your DbContext with the DI container, you typically specify it to be scoped. In this way, the DI container creates a new instance of the DbContext for each request. You register the DbContext in Startup.ConfigureServices with the AddDbContext method.
```c#
-- Microsoft Docs: DbContext Lifetime, Configuration, and Initialization
```
However, it is also possible to register the DbContext with a "singleton" lifetime, meaning that a single instance of the DbContext will be shared across your entire application. This is generally not recommended for DbContext instances, as it can lead to issues with concurrency and data consistency.

To register the DbContext with a singleton lifetime, you can use the AddDbContextPool method instead of AddDbContext. However, you should be careful when using this approach, as it can introduce performance and concurrency issues if you're not careful.

Here's the relevant documentation from Microsoft:

Using a singleton instance of DbContext across the application can cause concurrency and data integrity issues. Use AddDbContextPool for a scoped instance of DbContext.
