# Deferred Execution
EF Core queries are subject to deferred execution, just like local queries. This allows you to build queries progressively. There is one aspect, however, in which EF Core has special deferred execution semantics, and that is when a subquery appears within a Select expression.

With `local queries, you get double-deferred execution`, because from a functional perspective, youâ€™re selecting a sequence of queries. So, if you enumerate the outer result sequence but never enumerate the inner sequences, the subquery will never execute.

With `EF Core, the subquery is executed at the same time as the main outer query. This prevents excessive round-tripping.`

For example, the following query executes in a `single round trip` upon reaching the first foreach statement:

```c#
using var dbContext = new NutshellContext ();

var query = from c in dbContext.Customers
            select
               from p in c.Purchases
               select new { c.Name, p.Price };

foreach (var customerPurchaseResults in query)
  foreach (var namePrice in customerPurchaseResults)
    Console.WriteLine ($"{ namePrice.Name} spent { namePrice.Price}");
```
Any navigation properties that you explicitly project are fully populated in a single round trip:
```c#
var query = from c in dbContext.Customers
            select new { c.Name, c.Purchases };

foreach (var row in query)
  foreach (Purchase p in row.Purchases)   // No extra round-tripping
    Console.WriteLine (row.Name + " spent " + p.Price);
```
But `if we enumerate a navigation property without first having either eagerly loaded or projected, deferred execution rules apply`. In the following example, EF Core executes another Purchases query on each loop iteration (assuming lazy loading is enabled):
```c#
foreach (Customer c in dbContext.Customers.ToArray())
  foreach (Purchase p in c.Purchases)    // Another SQL round-trip
    Console.WriteLine (c.Name + " spent " + p.Price);
```
This model is `advantageous when you want to selectively execute the inner loo`p, based on a test that can be performed only on the client:
```c#
foreach (Customer c in dbContext.Customers.ToArray())
  if (myWebService.HasBadCreditHistory (c.ID))
    foreach (Purchase p in c.Purchases)   // Another SQL round trip
      Console.WriteLine (c.Name + " spent " + p.Price);
```
`NOTE`
Note the use of ToArray in the previous two queries. By default, SQL Server cannot initiate a new query while the results of the current query are still being processed. Calling ToArray materializes the customers so that additional queries can be issued to retrieve purchases per customer. It is possible to configure SQL Server to allow multiple active result sets (MARS) by appending ;MultipleActiveResultSets=True to the database connection string. Use MARS with caution as it can mask a chatty database design that could be improved by eager loading and/or projecting the required data.

# what MultipleActiveResultSets is
`MultipleActiveResultSets` (MARS) is a feature of SQL Server that enables the execution of multiple active result sets (queries) on a single database connection. This allows a client application to execute multiple queries on the same database connection at the same time, which can improve performance by reducing the number of connections needed to the database.

Here is an example of how to use MARS in a connection string:

```c#
"Server=myServerAddress;Database=myDataBase;User Id=myUsername;Password=myPassword;MultipleActiveResultSets=True;"
```
In this example, the MultipleActiveResultSets property is set to True, indicating that MARS should be enabled for the database connection.

When using MultipleActiveResultSets (MARS), it is important to be cautious because it can mask underlying performance issues related to a chatty database design. MARS allows multiple queries to be executed on the same connection simultaneously, which can improve performance in some cases, but it can also result in increased resource usage and contention for shared resources such as CPU and memory.

In addition, MARS can introduce additional complexity to your application code, as you need to be aware of potential issues related to concurrency, transaction management, and connection pooling. It's important to thoroughly test and validate your application when using MARS to ensure that it behaves correctly and performs well under heavy load.
With MARS enabled, you can execute the two queries in parallel without needing to materialize the first query:

```c#
// Enable MARS in the connection string
var connectionString = "Server=myServerAddress;Database=myDatabase;MultipleActiveResultSets=True;";

// Query 1: retrieve all customers
var customers = dbContext.Customers.ToList();

// Query 2: retrieve all purchases for each customer
foreach (var customer in customers)
{
    customer.Purchases = dbContext.Purchases.Where(p => p.CustomerId == customer.Id).ToList();
}
```
In this case, both queries can be executed at the same time because MARS allows SQL Server to handle multiple active result sets. This can be more efficient than materializing the first query because it avoids the extra round trip to the database to retrieve the customers. However, it's important to use MARS with caution and to make sure your database design is optimized for efficient querying.

When MARS (Multiple Active Result Sets) is enabled in the connection string, it allows SQL Server to initiate multiple queries at the same time, even if the results of the current query are still being processed. This means that if you have a query that is still being executed, you can issue another query without having to wait for the first one to complete.

In the context of the example I provided earlier, when MARS is enabled, the two queries can be executed at the same time. The first query retrieves the customers, and while the results are being processed, the second query retrieves the purchases for each customer. This can lead to improved performance and reduced latency, especially when dealing with large datasets or chatty databases.

. The first query needs to return at least one record so that the second query can use the customer ID from that record to retrieve the related purchases. Without the ToArray() method, the first query is not materialized, and the second query cannot execute because it depends on the first query's results.

# what otential issues related to concurrency, transaction management, and connection pooling relating to MARS?
Using MultipleActiveResultSets (MARS) can lead to potential issues related to concurrency, transaction management, and connection pooling.

`Concurrency`: MARS allows for multiple active result sets on a single connection. This means that multiple queries can be executed simultaneously on a single connection. However, it also means that there is the potential for concurrent access to the same data. This can lead to concurrency issues such as deadlocks and race conditions.

`Transaction management`: MARS can also affect transaction management. If you have multiple active result sets on a single connection and try to start a transaction, the transaction will be started on all active result sets. If one of the active result sets encounters an error, it can cause the entire transaction to fail.

`Connection pooling`: MARS can also impact connection pooling. When a connection is returned to the connection pool, it must be reset to its initial state so that it can be reused for another query. However, if there are multiple active result sets on the connection, it cannot be reset until all of the result sets have been processed. This can lead to connection pool exhaustion, where all connections are tied up waiting for result sets to complete.

To avoid these potential issues, it is recommended to use MARS with caution and only when necessary. It is also important to thoroughly test your application to ensure that it can handle the increased complexity and potential issues introduced by MARS.
