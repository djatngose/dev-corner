# Digital Signing
You also can use public key algorithms to digitally sign messages or documents. A signature is like a hash, except that its production requires a private key and so cannot be forged. The public key is used to verify the signature. Here’s an example:
```c#
byte[] data = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes ("Message to sign");
    byte[] publicKey;
    byte[] signature;
    object hasher = SHA1.Create();         // Our chosen hashing algorithm.
    // Generate a new key pair, then sign the data with it:
    using (var publicPrivate = new RSACryptoServiceProvider())
    {
      signature = publicPrivate.SignData (data, hasher);
      publicKey = publicPrivate.ExportCspBlob (false);    // get public key
    }
    // Create a fresh RSA using just the public key, then test the signature.
    using (var publicOnly = new RSACryptoServiceProvider())
    {
      publicOnly.ImportCspBlob (publicKey);
      Console.Write (publicOnly.VerifyData (data, hasher, signature)); // True
      // Let's now tamper with the data and recheck the signature:
      data[0] = 0;
      Console.Write (publicOnly.VerifyData (data, hasher, signature)); // False
      // The following throws an exception as we're lacking a private key:
      signature = publicOnly.SignData (data, hasher);
    }
```

Signing works by first hashing the data and then applying the asymmetric algorithm to the resultant hash. Because hashes are of a small fixed size, large documents can be signed relatively quickly (public key encryption is much more CPU-intensive than hashing). If you want, you can do the hashing yourself and then call SignHash instead of SignData:
    using (var rsa = new RSACryptoServiceProvider())
    {
byte[] hash = SHA1.Create().ComputeHash (data);
signature = rsa.SignHash (hash, CryptoConfig.MapNameToOID ("SHA1")); ...
}
SignHash still needs to know what hash algorithm you used; CryptoConfig.Map NameToOID provides this information in the correct format from a friendly name such as “SHA1”.
RSACryptoServiceProvider produces signatures whose size matches that of the key. Currently, no mainstream algorithm produces secure signatures significantly smaller than 128 bytes (suitable for product activation codes, for instance).
