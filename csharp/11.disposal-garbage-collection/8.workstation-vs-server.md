# Workstation versus server collection
.NET provides two garbage collection modes: workstation and server. Workstation is the default; you can switch to server by adding the following to your applica‐ tion’s .csproj file:
<PropertyGroup> <ServerGarbageCollection>true</ServerGarbageCollection>
</PropertyGroup>
Upon building your project, this setting is written to the application’s .runtime config.json file, where’s it’s read by the CLR:
      "runtimeOptions": {
        "configProperties": {
"System.GC.Server": true
...
1 The same thing can occur occasionally in the generational heap due to pinning (see “The fixed Statement” on page 244).

When server collection is enabled, the CLR allocates a separate heap and GC to each core. This speeds up collection but consumes additional memory and CPU resources (because each core requires its own thread). Should the machine be running many other processes with server collection enabled, this can lead to CPU oversubscription, which is particularly harmful on workstations because it makes the OS as a whole feel unresponsive.
Server collection is available only on multicore systems: on single-core devices (or single-core virtual machines), the setting is ignored.
