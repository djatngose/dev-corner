# Automatic Garbage Collection

Regardless of whether an object requires a Dispose method for custom tear-down logic, at some point the memory it occupies on the heap must be freed. The CLR handles this side of it entirely automatically via an automatic GC. You never deallocate managed memory yourself. For example, consider the following method:

public void Test()
{
  byte[] myArray = new byte[1000];
  ...
}
When Test executes, an array to hold 1,000 bytes is allocated on the memory heap. The array is referenced by the variable myArray, stored on the local variable stack. When the method exits, this local variable myArray pops out of scope, meaning that nothing is left to reference the array on the memory heap. The orphaned array then becomes eligible to be reclaimed in garbage collection.

`NOTE`
In debug mode with optimizations disabled, the lifetime of an object referenced by a local variable extends to the end of the code block to ease debugging. Otherwise, it becomes eligible for collection at the earliest point at which it’s no longer used.

`Garbage collection` does not happen immediately after an object is orphaned. Rather like garbage collection on the street, it happens periodically, although (unlike garbage collection on the street) not to a fixed schedule. The CLR bases its decision on when to collect upon a number of factors, such as the available memory, the amount of memory allocation, and the time since the last collection (the GC self-tunes to optimize for an application’s specific memory access patterns). This means that there’s an indeterminate delay between an object being orphaned and being released from memory. This delay can range from nanoseconds to days.

`NOTE`
The GC doesn’t collect all garbage with every collection. Instead, the memory manager divides objects into generations, and the GC collects new generations (recently allocated objects) more frequently than old generations (long-lived objects)

# GARBAGE COLLECTION AND MEMORY CONSUMPTION
The GC tries to strike a balance between the time it spends doing garbage collection and the application’s memory consumption (working set). Consequently, applications can consume more memory than they need, particularly if large temporary arrays are constructed.

You can monitor a process’s memory consumption via the Windows Task Manager or Resource Monitor—or programmatically by querying a performance counter:

// These types are in System.Diagnostics:
string procName = Process.GetCurrentProcess().ProcessName;
using PerformanceCounter pc = new PerformanceCounter
      ("Process", "Private Bytes", procName);
Console.WriteLine (pc.NextValue());
This queries the private working set, which gives the best overall indication of your program’s memory consumption. Specifically, it excludes memory that the CLR has internally deallocated and is willing to rescind to the OS should another process need it.

# Roots
A root is something that keeps an object alive. If an object is not directly or indirectly referenced by a root, it will be eligible for garbage collection.

A root is one of the following:

  - `A local variable` or parameter in an executing method (or in any method in its call stack)
  -` A static variable`
  - A`n object on the queue that stores objects ready for finalization `(see the next section)

It’s impossible for code to execute in a deleted object, so if there’s any possibility of an (instance) method executing, its object must somehow be referenced in one of these ways.

Note that a group of objects that reference one another cyclically are considered dead without a root referee (see Figure 12-1). To put it in another way, objects that cannot be accessed by following the arrows (references) from a root object are unreachable—and therefore subject to collection.

# Finalizers
Prior to an object being released from memory, its finalizer runs, if it has one. A finalizer is declared like a constructor, but it is prefixed by the ˜ symbol:

```c#
class Test
{
  ˜Test()
  {
    // Finalizer logic...
  }
}
```

(Although similar in declaration to a constructor, finalizers cannot be declared as public or static, cannot have parameters, and cannot call the base class.)

Finalizers are possible because garbage collection works in distinct phases. First, the GC identifies the unused objects ripe for deletion. Those without finalizers are deleted immediately. Those with pending (unrun) finalizers are kept alive (for now) and are put onto a special queue.

At that point, garbage collection is complete, and your program continues executing. The finalizer thread then kicks in and starts running in parallel to your program, picking objects off that special queue and running their finalization methods. Prior to each object’s finalizer running, it’s still very much alive—that queue acts as a root object. After it’s been dequeued and the finalizer executed, the object becomes orphaned and will be deleted in the next collection (for that object’s generation).

Finalizers can be useful, but they come with some provisos:

  - Finalizers slow the allocation and collection of memory (the GC needs to keep track of which finalizers have run).

  - Finalizers prolong the life of the object and any referred objects (they must all await the next garbage truck for actual deletion).

  - It’s impossible to predict in what order the finalizers for a set of objects will be called.

  - You have limited control over when the finalizer for an object will be called.

  - If code in a finalizer blocks, other objects cannot be finalized.

  - Finalizers can be circumvented altogether if an application fails to unload cleanly.

In summary, finalizers are somewhat like lawyers—although there are cases in which you really need them, in general you don’t want to use them unless absolutely necessary. If you do use them, you need to be 100% sure you understand what they are doing for you.

Here are some guidelines for implementing finalizers:

  - Ensure that your finalizer executes quickly.
  - Never block in your finalizer (see “Blocking”).
  - Don’t reference other finalizable objects.
  - Don’t throw exceptions.

# Calling Dispose from a Finalizer
A popular pattern is to have the finalizer call Dispose. This makes sense when cleanup is not urgent and hastening it by calling Dispose is more of an optimization than a necessity.

Keep in mind that with this pattern you couple memory deallocation to resource deallocation—two things with potentially divergent interests (unless the resource is itself memory). You also increase the burden on the finalization thread.

This pattern also serves as a backup for cases when a consumer simply forgets to call Dispose. However, it’s then a good idea to log the failure so that you can fix the bug.

There’s a standard pattern for implementing this, as follows:

class Test : IDisposable
{
  public void Dispose()             // NOT virtual
  {
    Dispose (true);
    GC.SuppressFinalize (this);     // Prevent finalizer from running.
  }

  protected virtual void Dispose (bool disposing)
  {
    if (disposing)
    {
      // Call Dispose() on other objects owned by this instance.
      // You can reference other finalizable objects here.
      // ...
    }

    // Release unmanaged resources owned by (just) this object.
    // ...
  }

  ~Test() => Dispose (false);
}
Dispose is overloaded to accept a bool disposing flag. The parameterless version is not declared as virtual and simply calls the enhanced version with true.

The enhanced version contains the actual disposal logic and is protected and virtual; this provides a safe point for subclasses to add their own disposal logic. The disposing flag means it’s being called “properly” from the Dispose method rather than in “last-resort mode” from the finalizer. The idea is that when called with disposing set to false, this method should not, in general, reference other objects with finalizers (because such objects might themselves have been finalized and so be in an unpredictable state). This rules out quite a lot! Here are a couple of tasks that the Dispose method can still perform in last-resort mode, when disposing is false:

  - Releasing any direct references to OS resources (obtained, perhaps, via a P/Invoke call to the Win32 API)
  - Deleting a temporary file created on construction
To make this robust, any code capable of throwing an exception should be wrapped in a try/catch block, and the exception, ideally, logged. Any logging should be as simple and robust as possible.

Notice that we call GC.SuppressFinalize in the parameterless Dispose method—this prevents the finalizer from running when the GC later catches up with it. Technically, this is unnecessary given that Dispose methods must tolerate repeated calls. However, doing so improves performance because it allows the object (and its referenced objects) to be garbage collected in a single cycle.

# why we need call  GC.SuppressFinalize (this)?
When you implement the IDisposable interface in a class, you typically also provide a finalizer to ensure that any unmanaged resources held by the object are released even if the Dispose method is not called. The finalizer is implemented using a destructor in C#, which is a method that is automatically called by the garbage collector when it determines that an object is no longer needed.

However, if the Dispose method is called on an object before the garbage collector runs, it's unnecessary to run the finalizer. This is because the Dispose method has already released any unmanaged resources held by the object, so there's no need to run the finalizer to do the same thing again.

To avoid running the finalizer unnecessarily, the Dispose method typically calls GC.SuppressFinalize to tell the garbage collector that the finalizer should not be run for the object. This ensures that the finalizer doesn't waste resources by releasing resources that have already been released by the Dispose method.

In the case of the Dispose method in MemoryStream, the GC.SuppressFinalize(this) call is included to prevent the finalizer from running, because the Dispose method already releases any unmanaged resources held by the object. This is a common pattern when implementing the IDisposable interface in C#.

# when finalizer run and release resource ?
The finalizer in C# is a special method that is called by the garbage collector when an object is about to be destroyed. The purpose of the finalizer is to release any unmanaged resources that the object may be holding onto, such as file handles or network connections.

The exact timing of when the finalizer is called is not deterministic and depends on the behavior of the garbage collector. In general, the garbage collector will run periodically to identify and reclaim memory that is no longer being used by the application. When the garbage collector identifies an object that is no longer being used, it first checks to see if the object has a finalizer. If the object has a finalizer, the garbage collector will add the object to a special queue called the finalization queue.

The finalization queue is processed by a separate thread called the finalizer thread. This thread is responsible for calling the finalizer method on each object in the queue. The exact timing of when the finalizer thread runs is not deterministic, but it typically runs after a certain amount of memory has been allocated or when the finalization queue reaches a certain size.

When the finalizer method is called, it should release any unmanaged resources held by the object. It's important to note that the finalizer is not guaranteed to run, and it should not be relied upon to release managed resources such as memory allocated on the heap. To ensure that managed resources are released in a timely manner, it's best to implement the IDisposable interface and call the Dispose method when the object is no longer needed.

In summary, the finalizer in C# is called by the garbage collector when an object is about to be destroyed, and its purpose is to release any unmanaged resources held by the object. The exact timing of when the finalizer is called is not deterministic, and it should not be relied upon to release managed resources.

# Resurrection
Suppose a finalizer modifies a living object such that it refers back to the dying object. When the next garbage collection happens (for the object’s generation), the CLR will see the previously dying object as no longer orphaned—and so it will evade garbage collection. This is an advanced scenario and is called resurrection.

To illustrate, suppose that we want to write a class that manages a temporary file. When an instance of that class is garbage collected, we’d like the finalizer to delete the temporary file. It sounds easy:

public class TempFileRef
{
  public readonly string FilePath;
  public TempFileRef (string filePath) { FilePath = filePath; }

  ~TempFileRef() { File.Delete (FilePath); }
}
Unfortunately, this has a bug: File.Delete might throw an exception (due to a lack of permissions, perhaps, or the file being in use, or having already been deleted). Such an exception would take down the entire application (as well as preventing other finalizers from running). We could simply “swallow” the exception with an empty catch block, but then we’d never know that anything went wrong. Calling some elaborate error reporting API would also be undesirable because it would burden the finalizer thread, hindering garbage collection for other objects. We want to restrict finalization actions to those that are simple, reliable, and quick.

A better option is to record the failure to a static collection, as follows:

public class TempFileRef
{
  static internal readonly ConcurrentQueue<TempFileRef> FailedDeletions
    = new ConcurrentQueue<TempFileRef>();

  public readonly string FilePath;
  public Exception DeletionError { get; private set; }

  public TempFileRef (string filePath) { FilePath = filePath; }

  ~TempFileRef()
  {
    try { File.Delete (FilePath); }
    catch (Exception ex)
    {
      DeletionError = ex;
      FailedDeletions.Enqueue (this);   // Resurrection
    }
  }
}
Enqueuing the object to the static FailedDeletions collection gives the object another referee, ensuring that it remains alive until the object is eventually dequeued.

`NOTE`
ConcurrentQueue<T> is a thread-safe version of Queue<T> and is defined in System.Collections.Concurrent (see Chapter 22). There are a couple of reasons for using a thread-safe collection. First, the CLR reserves the right to execute finalizers on more than one thread in parallel. This means that when accessing shared state such as a static collection, we must consider the possibility of two objects being finalized at once. Second, at some point we’re going to want to dequeue items from FailedDeletions so that we can do something about them. This also must be done in a thread-safe fashion because it could happen while the finalizer is concurrently enqueuing another object.

# GC.ReRegisterForFinalize

GC.ReRegisterForFinalize
A resurrected object’s finalizer will not run a second time—unless you call GC​.ReRe⁠gisterForFinalize.

In the following example, we try to delete a temporary file in a finalizer (as in the last example). But if the deletion fails, we reregister the object so as to try again in the next garbage collection:

public class TempFileRef
{
  public readonly string FilePath;
  int _deleteAttempt;

  public TempFileRef (string filePath) { FilePath = filePath; }

  ~TempFileRef()
  {
    try { File.Delete (FilePath); }
    catch
    {
      if (_deleteAttempt++ < 3) GC.ReRegisterForFinalize (this);
    }
  }
}
After the third failed attempt, our finalizer will silently give up trying to delete the file. We could enhance this by combining it with the previous example—in other words, adding it to the FailedDeletions queue after the third failure.

`WARNING`
Be careful to call ReRegisterForFinalize just once in the finalizer method. If you call it twice, the object will be reregistered twice and will have to undergo two more finalizations!
