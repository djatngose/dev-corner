# The Large Object Heap
The GC uses a separate heap called the Large Object Heap (LOH) for objects larger than a certain threshold (currently 85,000 bytes). This prevents the cost of compacting large objects and prevents excessive Gen0 collections—without the LOH, allocating a series of 16 MB objects might trigger a Gen0 collection after every allocation.
By default, the LOH is not subject to compaction, because moving large blocks of memory during garbage collection would be prohibitively expensive. This has two consequences:
• Allocations can be slower, because the GC can’t always simply allocate objects at the end of the heap—it must also look in the middle for gaps, and this requires maintaining a linked list of free memory blocks.1
• The LOH is subject to fragmentation. This means that the freeing of an object can create a hole in the LOH that can be difficult to fill later. For instance, a hole left by an 86,000-byte object can be filled only by an object of between 85,000 bytes and 86,000 bytes (unless adjoined by another hole).
Should you anticipate a problem with fragmentation, you can instruct the GC to compact the LOH in the next collection, as follows:
    GCSettings.LargeObjectHeapCompactionMode =
      GCLargeObjectHeapCompactionMode.CompactOnce;
Another workaround, if your program frequently allocates large arrays, is to use .NET’s array pooling API (see “Array Pooling” on page 575).
The LOH is also nongenerational: all objects are treated as Gen2.
