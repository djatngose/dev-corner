# Navigation Properties
Navigation properties allow you to do the following:
  - `Query related tables without having to manually join`
  - `Insert, remove, and update related rows without explicitly updating foreign keys`


For example, suppose that a customer can have a number of purchases. We can represent a one-to-many relationship between Customer and Purchase with the following entities:
```c#
public class Customer
{
  public int ID { get; set; }
  public string Name { get; set; }

  // Child navigation property, which must be of type ICollection<T>:
  public virtual List<Purchase> Purchases {get;set;} = new List<Purchase>();
}

public class Purchase
{        
  public int ID { get; set; }
  public DateTime Date { get; set; }
  public string Description { get; set; }
  public decimal Price { get; set; }
  public int CustomerID? { get; set; }     // Foreign key field

  public Customer Customer { get; set; }   // Parent navigation property
}
```
EF Core is able to infer from these entities that `CustomerID` is a foreign key to the Customer table, because the name` “CustomerID” follows a popular naming convention`. If we were to ask EF Core to create a database from these entities, it would create a foreign key constraint between Purchase.CustomerID and Customer.ID.

`NOTE`
If EF Core is unable to infer the relationship, you can configure it explicitly in the OnModelCreating method as follows:
```c#
modelBuilder.Entity<Purchase>()
  .HasOne (e => e.Customer)
  .WithMany (e => e.Purchases)
  .HasForeignKey (e => e.CustomerID);
```
With these navigation properties set up, we can write queries such as this:

var customersWithPurchases = Customers.Where (c => c.Purchases.Any());

# Adding and removing entities from navigation collections
When you add new entities to a collection navigation property, EF Core automatically populates the foreign keys upon calling SaveChanges:
```
Customer cust = dbContext.Customers.Single (c => c.ID == 1);

Purchase p1 = new Purchase { Description="Bike",  Price=500 };
Purchase p2 = new Purchase { Description="Tools", Price=100 };

cust.Purchases.Add (p1);
cust.Purchases.Add (p2);

dbContext.SaveChanges();
```
In this example, EF Core automatically writes 1 into the CustomerID column of each of the new purchases and writes the database-generated ID for each purchase to Purchase.ID.

When you `remove` an entity from a collection navigation property and call SaveChanges, EF Core will either `clear the foreign key field or delete the corresponding row from the database, depending on how the relationship has been configured or inferred`. 
In this case, we’ve defined `Purchase.CustomerID as a nullable integer (so that we can represent purchases without a customer, or cash transactions), so removing a purchase from a customer would clear its foreign key field rather than deleting it from the database.`

# Loading navigation properties
`When EF Core populates an entity, it does not (by default) populate its navigation properties:`
```c#
using var dbContext = new NutshellContext();
var cust = dbContext.Customers.First();
Console.WriteLine (cust.Purchases.Count);    // Always 0
```
One solution is to use the `Include` extension method, which instructs EF Core to `eagerly load navigation `properties:
```c#
var cust = dbContext.Customers 
  .Include (c => c.Purchases)
  .Where (c => c.ID == 2).First();
```

Another solution is to use a `projection`. This technique is particularly useful when you need to work with only some of the entity properties, because it reduces data transfer:
```c#
var custInfo = dbContext.Customers 
  .Where (c => c.ID == 2)
  .Select (c => new
    {
      Name = c.Name,
      Purchases = c.Purchases.Select (p => new { p.Description, p.Price })
    })
  .First();
```
`Both of these techniques inform EF Core what data you require so that it can be fetched in a single database query.` It’s also possible to manually instruct EF Core to populate a navigation property as needed:
```c#
dbContext.Entry (cust).Collection (b => b.Purchases).Load();
// cust.Purchases is now populated.
```
This is called `explicit loading`. Unlike the preceding approaches, this generates an `extra round trip to the database`. So, in this case, the first query loads the Customer entity, but not its related Purchases entities. Then, the explicit loading query loads the related Purchases entities, which requires a second roundtrip to the database.
# Lazy loading
Another approach for loading navigation properties is called `lazy loading`. When enabled, EF Core populates navigation properties on demand by generating a proxy class for each of your entity classes that intercepts attempts to access unloaded navigation properties.

For this to work, each navigation property must be `virtual`, and the class it’s defined in must be inheritable (not sealed). Also, the context must not have been disposed when the lazy load occurs, so that an `additional database request can be performed.`

You can enable lazy loading in the OnConfiguring method of your DbContext subclass, as follows:
```c#
protected override void OnConfiguring (DbContextOptionsBuilder 
                                       optionsBuilder)
{
  optionsBuilder
    .UseLazyLoadingProxies()
    ...
}
```
(You will also need to add a reference to the Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Proxies NuGet package.)

`The cost of lazy loading is that EF Core must make an additional request to the database each time you access an unloaded navigation property`. If you make many such requests, performance can suffer as a result of `excessive round-tripping.`

`NOTE`
With lazy loading enabled, the runtime type of your classes is a proxy derived from your entity class. For example:
```c#
using var dbContext = new NutshellContext();
var cust = dbContext.Customers.First();  
Console.WriteLine (cust.GetType());
// Castle.Proxies.CustomerProxy
```
