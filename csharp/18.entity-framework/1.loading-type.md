# Types of loading
In Entity Framework Core (EF Core), there are three main types of loading: Eager Loading, Lazy Loading, and Explicit Loading.

`Eager Loading`: In this type of loading, related data is loaded at the same time as the main entity using the Include() method. Eager loading can help reduce the number of database queries required to retrieve data and can improve query performance. However, it can also result in unnecessary data being retrieved if not used.

Suppose we have two entities, Order and Customer, where each order belongs to a single customer. We can use eager loading to retrieve all orders and their associated customers in a single query, like this:

```c#
// retrieve all orders and their associated customers
var orders = context.Orders.Include(o => o.Customer).ToList();
```
In this example, the Include() method is used to eagerly load the Customer entity related to each Order entity.


`Lazy Loading:` In this type of loading, related data is not loaded at the same time as the main entity, but is instead loaded automatically when accessed for the first time. This can lead to additional database queries being executed as the related data is accessed, which can negatively impact performance. To use lazy loading, you need to enable it explicitly in your EF Core context configuration.

// configure context to use lazy loading
protected override void OnConfiguring(DbContextOptionsBuilder optionsBuilder)
{
    optionsBuilder.UseLazyLoadingProxies();
}
After enabling lazy loading, you can load related data on demand by accessing the navigation properties of your entities. For example:

```c#
// retrieve an order and its associated customer (using lazy loading)
var order = context.Orders.Find(1);
var customer = order.Customer; // related customer is loaded automatically
```
In this example, accessing the Customer property of the Order entity triggers lazy loading of the related Customer entity.

`Explicit Loading`: In this type of loading, related data is loaded on demand using the Load() method. Explicit loading can be useful in situations where you only need to load related data in specific scenarios, as it allows you to retrieve data as needed without requiring additional queries or loading unnecessary data.

Suppose we have an entity Customer with a collection navigation property Orders. We can use explicit loading to load the orders for a specific customer on demand, like this:

```c#
// retrieve a customer and load their orders (using explicit loading)
var customer = context.Customers.Find(1);
context.Entry(customer).Collection(c => c.Orders).Load();
```
In this example, the Load() method is used to explicitly load the Orders collection for the Customer entity with ID 1.

Note that explicit loading can also be used to load related entities that are not collections, using the Reference() method instead of the Collection() method.

`Explicit loading in EF generates an extra round trip to the database because it retrieves related entities from the database only when they are explicitly requested by the developer`. When you execute an explicit load operation, EF generates a new SQL query to the database to retrieve the related entities.

For example, consider the following code:

```c#
using (var context = new MyDbContext())
{
    var order = context.Orders.First();
    context.Entry(order).Collection(o => o.OrderItems).Load();
}
```
In this code, we first retrieve an Order entity from the database. Then, we use the Load method to explicitly load the related OrderItems collection for the retrieved Order. When we call the Load method, EF generates a new SQL query to the database to retrieve the related OrderItems.

This extra round trip to the database can impact performance, especially if you have a large number of entities that need to be explicitly loaded. In some cases, it may be more efficient to use eager loading or projection to retrieve the required data in a single query.
