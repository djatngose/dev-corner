# How  Parallel.ForEach works?
Parallel.ForEach is a method in the System.Threading.Tasks namespace in .NET that allows you to process a collection of items in parallel across multiple threads.

Here's a general overview of how it works:

The method partitions the input collection into smaller chunks and distributes them across the available threads. Each thread processes its assigned chunk independently.

As each item in the chunk is processed, any changes made to that item are stored in a thread-safe manner.

Once all the threads have finished processing their assigned chunks, the changes made to each item are combined into a single result.

The method takes two arguments: the input collection, and an action to perform on each item in the collection. The action is executed once for each item in the collection, and can be any code that takes an item as input and performs some operation on it.

For example, here's how you might use Parallel.ForEach to process a list of integers and compute the sum:

csharp
Copy code
List<int> numbers = new List<int> { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 };

int sum = 0;
Parallel.ForEach(numbers, num =>
{
    sum += num;
});

Console.WriteLine(sum); // Output: 55
In this example, the Parallel.ForEach method partitions the list of numbers into chunks and distributes them across multiple threads. Each thread computes the sum of its assigned chunk, and any changes to the sum variable are synchronized across threads to ensure correctness. Once all the threads have finished processing their chunks, the final result is computed by combining the partial sums from each thread.

# how many items in list so we can use the case AsParallel()?
The decision to use AsParallel() should not depend solely on the number of items in the list, as this may not always be an accurate indicator of the performance gains from parallelization. Instead, it depends on a variety of factors, such as the complexity of the operations being performed on the items, the available hardware resources, and the degree of parallelism required.

In general, AsParallel() can be useful for operations that involve a large number of independent computations that can be parallelized, such as data processing, sorting, and filtering. It can also be beneficial for operations that take a long time to complete, as parallelization can help distribute the workload across multiple threads and improve overall performance.

However, it's important to note that parallelization comes with overhead costs, such as thread creation and synchronization, which can reduce the performance gains for small or simple operations. Therefore, it's recommended to carefully benchmark and test the performance of your code with and without AsParallel() to determine if it provides significant improvements in your specific use case.
