# Key Management
Key management is a critical element of security: if your keys are exposed, so is your data. You need to consider who should have access to keys and how to back them up in case of hardware failure while storing them in a manner that prevents unauthorized access.
It is inadvisable to hardcode encryption keys because popular tools exist to decom‐ pile assemblies with little expertise required. A better option (on Windows) is to manufacture a random key for each installation, storing it securely with Windows Data Protection.
For applications deployed to the cloud, Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS) offer key-management systems with additional features that can be useful in an enterprise environment, such as audit trails.
If you’re encrypting a message stream, public-key encryption still provides the best option.
