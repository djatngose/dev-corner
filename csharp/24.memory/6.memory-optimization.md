# Working with Stack-Allocated and Unmanaged Memory
Another effective micro-optimization technique is to `reduce the load on the garbage collector by minimizing heap-based allocations`. This means making greater use of `stack-based memory or even unmanaged memory`.
  - Using stack-based memory or unmanaged memory usually requires the use of pointers, which can be error-prone and difficult to manage.
  - In the case of the example that sums elements in an array, `a pointer-based version` of the code would need to be written to `use stack-based memory instead of the heap`. This can be a significant rewrite of the code, but it can result in better performance and lower memory usage.

Unfortunately, this normally requires that you rewrite code to use `pointers`. In the case of our previous example that summed elements in an array, we would need to write another version as follows:
```c#
unsafe int Sum (int* numbers, int length) {
int total = 0;
for (int i = 0; i < length; i++)
 total += numbers [i]; return total;
}
```
`Spans` solve this problem: you can construct a `Span<T> or ReadOnlySpan<T> directly from a pointer`:
```c#
    public static unsafe void RunUnsafeOptimizeSpan()
    {
        Span<int> numbers = stackalloc int [1000];// Allocate array on the stack
        int total = Sum (numbers);
        
        Console.WriteLine(total);
        unsafe int Sum(ReadOnlySpan<int> numbers)
        {
            int total = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < numbers.Length; i++) total += numbers[i];
            return total;
        }
        
    }
```

This method works equally well for a `stack-allocated span`. We have `gained` on three counts:
  • The same method works with both arrays and stack-allocated memory.
  • We can use stack-allocated memory with minimal use of pointers.
  • The span can be sliced.

`Note`: The compiler is smart enough to prevent you from writing a method that allocates memory on the stack and returns it to the caller via a `Span<T> or ReadOnlySpan<T>`.
(In other scenarios, however, you can legally return a Span<T> or ReadOnlySpan<T>.)

You can also use `spans` to `wrap memory that you allocate from the unmanaged heap`. In the following example, we:
  - Allocate `unmanaged memory using the Marshal.AllocHGlobal function`
  - Wrap it in a `Span<char>`
  - Then copy a string into the `unmanaged memory`.
  - Finally, we employ the CharSpanSplitter struct that we wrote in the preceding section to split the unmanaged string into words:

```c#
 var source = "The quick brown fox".AsSpan();
    var ptr = Marshal.AllocHGlobal (source.Length * sizeof (char));
    try
    {
      var unmanaged = new Span<char> ((char*)ptr, source.Length);
      source.CopyTo (unmanaged);
      foreach (var word in unmanaged.Split())
        Console.WriteLine (word.ToString());
    }
    finally {
       Marshal.FreeHGlobal (ptr);
     }
```
A nice bonus is that Span<T>’s indexer performs bounds-checking, preventing a buffer overrun. This protection applies if you correctly instantiate Span<T>: in our example, you would lose this protection if you wrongly obtained the span:
```c#
var span = new Span<char> ((char*)ptr, source.Length * 2);
```
There’s also no protection from the equivalent of a dangling pointer, so you must take care not to access the span after releasing its unmanaged memory with Marshal.FreeHGlobal.
