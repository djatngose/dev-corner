`Span<T> and Memory<T>` are two related types in C# that were introduced in version 2.1 of the .NET runtime. Both are used for efficient manipulation of arrays, especially when dealing with large amounts of data.

A Span<T> is a contiguous region of memory that can contain elements of any type T. It is essentially a view over an array, pointer, or native memory. Because it is a view over a memory block, it does not have its own memory allocation or disposal. Span<T> is a value type, which means that copying a Span<T> copies the underlying memory, not just the reference to it.

A Memory<T> is similar to a Span<T>, but it has more functionality related to memory allocation and disposal. It can represent a memory block that is owned by the Memory<T> instance itself, or it can be a view over memory owned by another object. Memory<T> is a reference type, which means that copying it creates a new reference to the same underlying memory.

You can use Span<T> and Memory<T> in a variety of scenarios, such as when working with large arrays or when optimizing performance-critical code. They can be particularly useful when working with unmanaged code or when writing low-level code that needs to be efficient and safe.

For example, when reading data from a file or network stream, you can use a Memory<byte> to represent the buffer into which the data will be read. Similarly, you can use a Span<T> to manipulate elements in an array, or to pass a subset of an array to a method without creating a new array.

Overall, Span<T> and Memory<T> are useful tools for working with large amounts of data in a safe and efficient manner, and are well worth considering when optimizing your code.

# what different between Span and Memory
Both Span<T> and Memory<T> are new types introduced in C# 7.2 for working with contiguous regions of memory in a safer and more efficient way.

Span<T> represents a contiguous region of arbitrary memory and provides a safe and efficient way to perform operations on the underlying memory. It is a value type that can only be used with stack allocation. It can be used to access and manipulate arrays, stackalloc'ed memory, or native memory allocated by unmanaged code.

Memory<T> is similar to Span<T>, but it is a reference type that can be used with heap allocation. It represents an owned memory block that can be resized or released when it's no longer needed. It provides additional methods for managing the lifetime of the memory block, such as Dispose, Pin, and Slice.

In summary, Span<T> is used when you need to work with contiguous memory regions in a safe and efficient way, and you can allocate the memory on the stack or work with existing memory. Memory<T> is used when you need to manage the lifetime of memory blocks that are allocated on the heap and potentially resized or released.

# use cases 
Spans and Memories are commonly used when working with arrays or other contiguous blocks of memory, especially when high performance and low overhead are important.

Here are some examples of when to use `Spans`:

  - Parsing data from a large buffer of bytes, such as when reading from a socket or file
  - Working with strings or other character data, such as in text processing or parsing
  - Manipulating arrays or other contiguous blocks of memory, such as in graphics or numerical computations
  - Interacting with unmanaged code or APIs that work with memory pointers


And here are some examples of when to use `Memories`:

  - Reading or writing large blocks of data, such as when copying files or sending data over a network
  - Processing streams of data, such as audio or video
  - Implementing memory caches or pools, to avoid excessive memory allocations and deallocations
  - Interacting with unmanaged code or APIs that work with memory pointers, but with the added safety and convenience of managed memory management
