# Slicing
They also enable `slicing—working with a portion of an array, string, or memory block without creating a copy`.

When working with arrays, strings, or blocks of memory in C#, it's sometimes necessary to extract a portion of the data to work with, without creating a new copy of the data. The Span<T> and Memory<T> types in C# provide this ability through the concept of "slicing".

Slicing allows you to work with a portion of an existing array, string, or memory block, without making a copy of that data. Instead, you create a new Span<T> or Memory<T> object that represents the slice of the original data. This can be useful when working with large amounts of data, as it can save memory and time that would otherwise be spent copying data.

Suppose that you’re writing a method to sum an array of integers. A micro- optimized implementation would avoid LINQ in favor of a foreach loop:
```c#
int Sum (int[] numbers)
{
  int total = 0;
  foreach (int i in numbers) total += i; return total;
}
```
Now imagine that you want to sum just a portion of the array. You have two options:
• First copy the portion of the array that you want to sum into another array.
• Add additional parameters (offset and count).

The `first option` is inefficient; the second option adds clutter and complexity (which
worsens with methods that need to accept more than one array).

`Spans` solve this nicely. All you need to do is to change the parameter type from
int[] to ReadOnlySpan<int> (everything else stays the same):
```c#
int Sum (ReadOnlySpan<int> numbers) {
      int total = 0;
      foreach (int i in numbers) total += i;
      return total;
}
```
`Note`: We used `ReadOnlySpan<T>` rather than `Span<T>` because we don’t need to modify the array. There’s an implicit conversion from `Span<T>` to `ReadOnlySpan<T>`, so you can pass a `Span<T>` into a method that expects a `ReadOnlySpan<T>`.
We can test this method, as follows:
```c#
var numbers = new int [1000];
for (int i = 0; i < numbers.Length; i++) numbers [i] = i;
int total = Sum (numbers);
```
We can call `Sum` with an `array because there’s an implicit conversion from T[] to Span<T> and ReadOnlySpan<T>`. Another option is to use the `AsSpan` extension method:
```c#
var span = numbers.AsSpan();
```

The indexer for` ReadOnlySpan<T>` uses` C#’s ref readonly` feature to reach directly into the underlying data: this allows our method to perform almost as well as the original example that used an array. But what we’ve gained is that we can now “slice” the array and sum just a portion of the elements as follows:
  - By `using ref readonly`, the compiler generates code that directly accesses the memory location of the specified index in the span, avoiding the need to create a new object or copy data. This can help improve performance when working with large arrays or memory blocks.
```c#
// Sum the middle 500 elements (starting from position 250):
 int total = Sum (numbers.AsSpan (250, 500));
```

If you already have a Span<T> or ReadOnlySpan<T>, you can slice it by calling the Slice method:
```c#
Span<int> span = numbers;
int total = Sum (span.Slice (250, 500));

```
You can also use C#’s indices and ranges (from C# 8):
```c#
Span<int> span = numbers;
Console.WriteLine (span [^1]);            // Last element
Console.WriteLine (Sum (span [..10]));    // First 10 elements
Console.WriteLine (Sum (span [100..]));   // 100th element to end
Console.WriteLine (Sum (span [^5..]));    // Last 5 elements
```

Although Span<T> doesn’t implement IEnumerable<T> (it can’t implement interfaces by virtue of being a ref struct), it does implement the pattern, which allows C#’s foreach statement to work

# Another example, consider an array of integers with 10 elements:
```c#
int[] array = { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 };

```
To extract a portion of this array, you could create a new array and copy the relevant elements:
```c#
int[] subset = new int[5];
Array.Copy(array, 2, subset, 0, 5);
```
This creates a new array containing the elements from index 2 to 6 of the original array. However, this also involves copying the data, which can be slow and memory-intensive.

With Span<T> and Memory<T>, you can create a slice of the original array without copying the data:
```c#
Span<int> subset = array.AsSpan(2, 5);

```
This creates a new Span<int> object that represents the elements from index 2 to 6 of the original array. You can then work with this Span<int> object directly, without copying the data.

Overall, the ability to slice data using Span<T> and Memory<T> can be useful when working with large amounts of data, as it can help reduce memory usage and improve performance by avoiding unnecessary copies of data.

`Note`: if you change the data in a slice obtained from an array or memory block, it will affect the original data. This is because the slice does not create a copy of the original data, but rather provides a view of a portion of the original data.
```c#
int[] numbers = { 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 };
Span<int> slice = numbers.AsSpan(1, 3); // slice contains { 2, 3, 4 }
slice[1] = 99; // modify the second element of the slice
//OUTPUT
[1,2,99,4,5]
```
