# Span<T>
`Span<T> is a value type`

`Span<T> and Memory<T>` are two related types in C# that were introduced in version 2.1 of the .NET runtime. Both are used for efficient manipulation of arrays, especially when dealing with large amounts of data.

A Span<T> is a contiguous region of memory that can contain elements of any type T. It is essentially a view over an array, pointer, or native memory. Because it is a view over a memory block, it does not have its own memory allocation or disposal. Span<T> is a value type, which means that copying a Span<T> copies the underlying memory, not just the reference to it.

A Memory<T> is similar to a Span<T>, but it has more functionality related to memory allocation and disposal. It can represent a memory block that is owned by the Memory<T> instance itself, or it can be a view over memory owned by another object. Memory<T> is a reference type, which means that copying it creates a new reference to the same underlying memory.

You can use Span<T> and Memory<T> in a variety of scenarios, such as when working with large arrays or when optimizing performance-critical code. They can be particularly useful when working with unmanaged code or when writing low-level code that needs to be efficient and safe.

For example, when reading data from a file or network stream, you can use a Memory<byte> to represent the buffer into which the data will be read. Similarly, you can use a Span<T> to manipulate elements in an array, or to pass a subset of an array to a method without creating a new array.

Overall, Span<T> and Memory<T> are useful tools for working with large amounts of data in a safe and efficient manner, and are well worth considering when optimizing your code.

`Span<T> type` in C# provides a unified interface for accessing the elements of an array, string, or memory block. By using Span<T>, you can work with data in a similar way, `regardless of whether it is stored in a managed array or a memory block allocated on the stack or in unmanaged memory.`

# Span is a ref struct
`Span<T> is a ref struct`, which means it has restrictions on how it can be stored and passed around. One such restriction is that `it cannot be stored in a field of a class or a struct`. This is because Span<T> needs to be stack-allocated, and its lifetime must be shorter than the object that contains it. Therefore, Span<T> can be used to wrap stack-allocated memory, but it cannot be stored in heap-allocated memory.

On the other hand, `Memory<T> is a class and does not have the same restrictions as Span<T>. It can be stored in a field of a class or a struct and can be passed around without any limitations. However, Memory<T> cannot wrap stack-allocated memory, which means it can only be used with heap-allocated memory.`

Both `Span<T> and Memory<T>` provide the benefit of slicing, which allows working with a portion of an array or memory block without creating a copy.

# ReadOnlySpan<T> and ReadOnlyMemory<T>
When we use the read-only counterparts `ReadOnlySpan<T> and ReadOnlyMemory<T>`, we can't accidentally modify the underlying data, as these types only provide read-only access to the data. By making this restriction explicit, it allows the compiler and runtime to make additional optimizations, as it can assume that the data will not be modified. This can lead to improved performance in certain scenarios, as the compiler and runtime can take advantage of this knowledge to optimize the generated code.

# ArraySegment<T> vs Span<T>
 Span<T> and Memory<T> types have a feature that allows you to work with a portion of an array, string, or memory block without creating a copy, which is similar to what the ArraySegment<T> class can do. However, because Span<T> and Memory<T> provide a more flexible and powerful mechanism for working with arrays, the `old ArraySegment<T> class has become redundant and is no longer needed in most cases`.

# How it works?
It provides a common array-like interface over managed arrays, strings, and pointer-backed memory. This gives you the freedom to `employ stack-allocated and unmanaged memory to avoid garbage collection, without having to dupli‐ cate code or mess with pointers. `

It allows` “slicing”`: exposing reusable subsections of the span without making copies.

`Span<T> `comprises just two fields, a` pointer and a length`. For this reason, it can represent only contiguous blocks of memory. (Should you need to work with noncontiguous memory, the ReadOnlySequence<T> class is available to serve as a linked list.)

Because Span<T> can wrap stack-allocated memory, there are restrictions on how you can store or pass around instances (imposed, in part, by Span<T> being a ref struct). Memory<T> acts as a span without those restrictions, but it cannot wrap stack-allocated memory. Memory<T> still provides the benefit of slicing.

Each struct comes with a read-only counterpart (ReadOnlySpan<T> and ReadOnly Memory<T>). As well as preventing unintentional change, the read-only counterparts further improve performance by allowing the compiler and runtime additional freedom for optimization.

.NET itself (and ASP.NET Core) use these types to improve efficiency with I/O, networking, string handling, and JSON parsing.

# what difference ArraySegment vs Span?
`ArraySegment<T> and Span<T> `both provide the ability to work with a contiguous portion of an array without copying data. However, there are some differences between them:

`ArraySegment<T> `is a class, `while Span<T> `is a value type struct. This means that `ArraySegment<T> is always allocated on the heap, whereas Span<T> can be allocated on the stack.`

`ArraySegment<T>` is primarily used with `arrays`, whereas `Span<T> can be used with arrays, strings, and other memory types.`

`Span<T> provides more functionality than ArraySegment<T>. For example, Span<T> supports slicing, whereas ArraySegment<T> does not.`

ArraySegment<T> can be used to wrap an array that was allocated by another component. This can be useful in some situations where you need to pass the array to a method that expects an ArraySegment<T>. Span<T> cannot be used in this way.

In summary, ArraySegment<T> is a more limited type than Span<T>, but can still be useful in some situations, particularly when working with APIs that expect an ArraySegment<T> parameter. Span<T> provides more functionality and is more versatile, but requires a more modern version of the .NET runtime.

# When we dont need to use span?
Small Data or Infrequent Manipulations: If you're dealing with small data structures or the need to manipulate the data in place is infrequent, the benefits of using Span (low-level performance optimizations, stack allocation, etc.) may not outweigh the complexity it adds to the code.

Read-only Operations: If you're primarily performing read-only operations on an array or collection and you're not concerned about memory allocations or performance bottlenecks, using the basic array operations provided by the language (e.g., indexing) may be sufficient and easier to understand.

Non-Contiguous Data: If your data is not contiguous or requires complex manipulation that goes beyond simple slices, using Span might not provide significant advantages. For example, if you're dealing with linked lists, trees, or other data structures with non-contiguous memory, Span won't be as suitable.

High-Level Abstractions: If you're working with high-level abstractions provided by libraries or frameworks, those abstractions might internally handle memory management and optimizations, making the use of Span unnecessary for your specific use case.

Code Clarity: While Span can provide performance benefits, it can also make the code more complex. If the performance gains are negligible for your specific application and code clarity is a higher priority, you might choose to avoid using Span to keep the code more understandable.

# When to use span?
Performance-Critical Code:

If you're writing high-performance code, such as low-level algorithms, data processing, or performance-sensitive parts of your application, Span can help minimize memory copying and improve cache locality.
Memory Efficiency:

When you want to avoid unnecessary memory allocations. Spans allow you to work with existing memory without creating additional arrays or buffers, reducing the memory overhead.
Working with Subsets of Data:

When you need to operate on a portion of an existing array or collection without creating a new copy. Spans allow you to create a view over a portion of the data with minimal overhead.
Unsafe Contexts:

In languages like C#, when working in an unsafe context (using the unsafe keyword), Span can provide a safer way to work with pointers and stack-allocated memory while still maintaining bounds checking.
Faster String Manipulation:

In C# and similar languages, Span can significantly speed up string manipulation, especially when dealing with substrings or when you need to modify strings in place.
Interoperability:

When you need to interface with APIs that expect or return spans, such as certain data processing libraries or APIs designed for efficient memory handling.
Reducing Memory Fragmentation:

When you're dealing with frequently changing data sizes and want to avoid the memory fragmentation that can occur with frequent resizing of arrays.
Large Data Structures:

When you're working with large data structures and need to minimize memory consumption or improve performance by avoiding unnecessary copying.
