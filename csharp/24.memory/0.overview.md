# Span<T> and Memory<T>
The `Span<T> and Memory<T> `structs act as low-level fa√ßades over an array, string, or any contiguous block of managed or unmanaged memory.

Their main purpose is to help with certain kinds of `micro-optimization` in particular, writing low-allocation code that `minimizes managed memory allocations (thereby reducing the load on the garbage collector)` without having to duplicate your code for different kinds of input.
