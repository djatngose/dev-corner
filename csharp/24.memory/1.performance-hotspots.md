# what is performance hotspots?
Performance hotspots refer to the parts of a program where a significant amount of time is spent during execution, and therefore, optimizing these parts can lead to significant performance gains. These hotspots can vary depending on the application, but common examples include tight loops, I/O operations, and memory allocations.

Optimizing performance hotspots can involve a variety of techniques, including the use of efficient data structures, parallelization, and algorithmic improvements. The use of Span<T> and Memory<T> types in performance-critical areas of an application can also help reduce unnecessary memory allocations and improve performance.

# ASP.NET Core processing pipeline
In ASP.NET Core, the request pipeline is composed of middleware components that are executed in a specific order to handle incoming requests. Middleware components can read and modify the HTTP request and response data. Since the pipeline is executed for every incoming request, it is important to optimize the performance of the middleware components.

One way to do this is by using `Span<T> and Memory<T>` to avoid unnecessary copying of data. For example, let's say we have a middleware component that reads the request body as a JSON string, deserializes it into an object, and then performs some processing on the object:

```c#
public class JsonMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public JsonMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        using (var reader = new StreamReader(context.Request.Body))
        {
            var json = await reader.ReadToEndAsync();
            var obj = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(json);
            // perform processing on obj
        }

        await _next(context);
    }
}

```
In this code, we are reading the entire request body into a string (`json`) and then deserializing it into an object (`obj`). This involves unnecessary copying of data, which can impact the performance of the middleware component.

Instead, we can use `Span<T> and Memory<T>` to work with the request body directly, without creating any intermediate copies. Here's an updated version of the middleware component that uses `Memory<byte>` to read the request body and `Utf8JsonReader` to parse the JSON:

```c#
public class JsonMiddleware
{
    private readonly RequestDelegate _next;

    public JsonMiddleware(RequestDelegate next)
    {
        _next = next;
    }

    public async Task InvokeAsync(HttpContext context)
    {
        var buffer = new byte[4096];
        var bytesRead = 0;

        using (var stream = context.Request.Body)
        {
            var memory = new Memory<byte>(buffer);

            while ((bytesRead = await stream.ReadAsync(memory)) > 0)
            {
                var span = memory.Slice(0, bytesRead).Span;
                var reader = new Utf8JsonReader(span);

                while (reader.Read())
                {
                    // handle each token
                }
            }
        }

        await _next(context);
    }
}

```
In this code, we are using a buffer of 4096 bytes to read the request body in chunks. We create a Memory<byte> from the buffer and use it to read data from the request stream using ReadAsync(). We then create a Span<byte> from the Memory<byte> using Slice() and pass it to Utf8JsonReader to parse the JSON. By doing this, we avoid unnecessary copying of data and improve the performance of the middleware component.

# JSON parser for an object database
In an object database, JSON data is often used to store and retrieve objects. To parse the JSON data, a JSON parser is used. Since parsing large JSON documents can be a performance hotspot, it is important to optimize the parser for performance.

One way to do this is by using Span<T> and Memory<T> to avoid unnecessary copying of data. For example, let's say we have a JSON parser that reads a JSON document as a string and then parses it into an object:j

```c#
using System;
using System.Text.Json;
using System.Text.Json.Serialization;

public class Person
{
    public string FirstName { get; set; }
    public string LastName { get; set; }
    public int Age { get; set; }
}

public class JsonParser
{
    public static Person Parse(string json)
    {
        ReadOnlySpan<byte> jsonBytes = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes(json);
        var reader = new Utf8JsonReader(jsonBytes);

        string firstName = string.Empty;
        string lastName = string.Empty;
        int age = 0;

        while (reader.Read())
        {
            if (reader.TokenType == JsonTokenType.PropertyName)
            {
                var propName = reader.GetString();

                if (propName.Equals("FirstName"))
                {
                    reader.Read();
                    firstName = reader.GetString();
                }
                else if (propName.Equals("LastName"))
                {
                    reader.Read();
                    lastName = reader.GetString();
                }
                else if (propName.Equals("Age"))
                {
                    reader.Read();
                    age = reader.GetInt32();
                }
            }
        }

        return new Person { FirstName = firstName, LastName = lastName, Age = age };
    }
}
 
```
