# Working with Text
Spans are designed to work well with strings, which are treated as ReadOnly Span<char>. The following method counts whitespace characters:
```c#
int CountWhitespace (ReadOnlySpan<char> s) {
      int count = 0;
      foreach (char c in s)
        if (char.IsWhiteSpace (c))
          count++;
      return count;
    }
```

You can call such a method with a string (thanks to an implicit conversion operator):
```c#
int x = CountWhitespace ("Word1 Word2");   // OK
```
or with a substring:
```c#
int y = CountWhitespace (someString.AsSpan (20, 10));
```
The `ToString() method converts a ReadOnlySpan<char> back to a string.`

# Extension methods
They ensure that some of the commonly used methods on the string class are also available to ReadOnlySpan<char>:
```c#
var span = "This ".AsSpan();                    // ReadOnlySpan<char>
Console.WriteLine (span.StartsWith ("This"));   // True
Console.WriteLine (span.Trim().Length);         // 4
```
(Note that methods such as `StartsWith` use ordinal comparison, whereas the corre‐ sponding methods on the string class use culture-sensitive comparison by default.)

Methods such as `ToUpper` and `ToLower` are available, but you must pass in a destination span with the correct length (this allows you to decide how and where to allocate the memory).

# Unvailable methods
Some of string’s methods are unavailable, such as `Split` (which splits a string into an array of words). It’s actually impossible to write the direct equivalent of string’s Split method because you cannot create an array of spans.
## Reason
This is because spans are defined as `ref structs`, which can exist only on the `stack.`(By “exist only on the stack,” we mean that the struct itself can exist only on the stack. The content that the span wraps can—and does, in this case—exist on the heap.)

# System.Buffers.Text 
The `System.Buffers.Text` namespace contains additional types to help you work with span-based text, including the following:
• `Utf8Formatter.TryFormat` does the equivalent of calling `ToString` on built-in and simple types such as decimal, DateTime, and so on but writes to a span instead of a string.
• U`tf8Parser.TryPars`e does the reverse and parses data from a span into a simple type.
• The `Base64` type provides methods for reading/writing base-64 data.
