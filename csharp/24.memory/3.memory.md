# Memory
`Memory<T> is similar to Span<T>`, but it is a `reference type that can be used with heap allocation`. 

`Span<T> and ReadOnlySpan<T>` are defined as `ref structs` to maximize their optimization potential as well as allowing them to work safely with stack-allocated memory (as you’ll see in the next section). 

It represents an owned memory block that can be resized or released when it's no longer needed. It provides additional methods for managing the lifetime of the memory block, such as `Dispose, Pin, and Slice`.

However, they also impose limitations. In addition to being array-unfriendly, they cannot be used as fields in a class (this would put them on the heap). This, in turn, prevents them from appearing in lambda expressions—and as parameters in asynchronous methods, iterators, and asynchronous streams:

```c#
async void Foo (Span<int> notAllowed); // Compile-time error!

async void Foo (Memory<int> notAllowed); // allowed
```

(Remember that the compiler processes asynchronous methods and iterators by writing a private state machine, which means that any parameters and local variables end up as fields. The same applies to lambda expressions that close over variables: these also end up as fields in a closure.)
`
The Memory<T> and ReadOnlyMemory<T>` structs work around this, acting as spans that cannot wrap stack-allocated memory, allowing their use in fields, lambda expressions, asynchronous methods, and so on.

You can obtain a `Memory<T> or ReadOnlyMemory<T>` from an array via an implicit conversion or the AsMemory() extension method:
```c#
Memory<int> mem1 = new int[] { 1, 2, 3 };
var mem2 = new int[] { 1, 2, 3 }.AsMemory();
```

You can easily “convert” a Memory<T> or ReadOnlyMemory<T> into a Span<T> or ReadOnlySpan<T> via its Span property so that you can interact with it as though it were a span. The conversion is efficient in that it doesn’t perform any copying:
```c#
async void Foo (Memory<int> memory) {
    Span<int> span = memory.Span;
... }
```
(You can also directly slice a Memory<T> or ReadOnlyMemory<T> via its Slice method or a C# range, and access its length via its Length property.)
`Note`: Another way to obtain a Memory<T> is to rent it from a pool, using the System.Buffers.MemoryPool<T> class. This works just like array pooling (see “Array Pooling” on page 575) and offers another strategy for reducing the load on the garbage collector.


# Split

We said in the previous section that you cannot write the direct equivalent of string.Split for spans, because you cannot create an array of spans. This limitation does not apply to ReadOnlyMemory<char>:
```c#
// Split a string into words:
IEnumerable<ReadOnlyMemory<char>> Split (ReadOnlyMemory<char> input) {
int wordStart = 0;
for (int i = 0; i <= input.Length; i++)
  if (i == input.Length || char.IsWhiteSpace (input.Span [i])) {
      yield return input [wordStart..i]; // Slice with C# range operator
      wordStart = i + 1;
  }
}
```
This is more efficient than string’s Split method: instead of creating new strings for each word, it returns slices of the original string:
```c#

    foreach (var slice in Split ("The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog"))
    {
// slice is a ReadOnlyMemory<char> }
```

# Write methods that accept Span<T> than Memory<T> when you have a choice.
You can easily `convert a Memory<T> into a Span<T> (via the Span property), but not vice versa`. For this reason, it’s `better to write methods that accept Span<T> than Memory<T> when you have a choice.`
  - Since `Span<T>` can be used to represent both stack-allocated and heap-allocated memory, it is a more general-purpose type that can be used in more scenarios.
-  `Span<T>` is a value type, whereas Memory<T> is a reference type, so `Span<T>` instances can be passed around more efficiently without the overhead of heap allocations and garbage collection.
-  While it is easy to convert a Memory<T> to a Span<T> via the Span property, the reverse conversion is not possible. So, if you write methods that accept Memory<T>, you are limiting the types of memory that can be passed to those methods.
  -  Yes, if your method returns a Memory<T>, you can always get a Span<T> from it using the Span property. However, if your method accepts a Memory<T> parameter, you cannot pass in a Span<T> directly - you need to first create a Memory<T> instance from the Span<T> using the Memory<T>.DangerousCreateFromPinnedArray method.
  - So, in terms of flexibility, it's better to write methods that accept Span<T> instead of Memory<T>, because it allows the caller to pass in either a Span<T> or Memory<T> instance without having to create a new Memory<T> instance from the Span<T> first. Additionally, Span<T> is generally more performant than Memory<T> for most scenarios, so accepting Span<T> as a parameter can provide a slight performance boost.

For the same reason, `it’s better to write methods that accept ReadOnlySpan<T> than Span<T>`.

# Forward-Only Enumerators
In the preceding section, we employed ReadOnlyMemory<char> as a solution to implementing a string-style Split method. But by giving up on ReadOnly Span<char>, we lost the ability to slice spans backed by unmanaged memory. Let’s revisit ReadOnlySpan<char> to see whether we can find another solution.
One possible option would be to write our Split method so that it returns ranges:
```c#
Range[] Split (ReadOnlySpan<char> input) {
int pos = 0;
var list = new List<Range>();
for (int i = 0; i <= input.Length; i++)
  if (i == input.Length || char.IsWhiteSpace (input [i]))
  {
    list.Add (new Range (pos, i));
    pos = i + 1;
  }
return list.ToArray();
}
```
The caller could then use those ranges to slice the original span:
```c#
ReadOnlySpan<char> source = "The quick brown fox"; foreach (Range range in Split (source))
{
ReadOnlySpan<char> wordSpan = source [range];
... }
```
This is an improvement, but it’s still imperfect. One of the reasons for using spans in the first place is to avoid memory allocations. But notice that our Split method creates a List<Range>, adds items to it, and then converts the list into an array. This incurs at least two memory allocations as well a memory-copy operation.
The solution to this is to eschew the list and array in favor of a forward-only enu‐ merator. An enumerator is clumsier to work with, but it can be made allocation-free with the use of structs:
```c#
// We must define this as a ref struct, because _input is a ref struct.
public readonly ref struct CharSpanSplitter
{
    readonly ReadOnlySpan<char> _input;
    public CharSpanSplitter(ReadOnlySpan<char> input) => _input = input;
    public Enumerator GetEnumerator() => new Enumerator(_input);

    public ref struct Enumerator // Forward-only enumerator
    {
        readonly ReadOnlySpan<char> _input;
        int _wordPos;
        public ReadOnlySpan<char> Current { get; private set; }

        public Enumerator(ReadOnlySpan<char> input)
        {
            _input = input;
            _wordPos = 0;
            Current = default;
        }

        public bool MoveNext()
        {
            for (int i = _wordPos; i <= _input.Length; i++)
                if (i == _input.Length || char.IsWhiteSpace(_input[i]))
                {
                    Current = _input[_wordPos..i];
                    _wordPos = i + 1;
                    return true;
                }

            return false;
        }
    }
}

public static class CharSpanExtensions
{
    public static CharSpanSplitter Split(this ReadOnlySpan<char> input)
        => new CharSpanSplitter(input);

    public static CharSpanSplitter Split(this Span<char> input)
        => new CharSpanSplitter(input);
}
//RUN

var span = "the quick brown fox".AsSpan();
foreach (var word in span.Split())
{
  // word is a ReadOnlySpan<char>
}
```
By defining a Current property and a MoveNext method, our enumerator can work with C#’s foreach statement (see “Enumeration” on page 189). We don’t have to implement the IEnumerable<T>/IEnumerator<T> interfaces (in fact, we can’t; ref structs can’t implement interfaces). We’re sacrificing abstraction for micro-optimization.
