# CopyTo and TryCopyTo
The CopyTo method copies elements from one span (or Memory<T>) to another. In the following example, we copy all of the elements from span x into span y:
```c#
Span<int> x = new[] { 1, 2, 3, 4 };
Span<int> y = new int[4];
x.CopyTo (y);

```
Slicing makes this method much more useful. In the next example, we copy the first half of span x into the second half of span y:
```c#
Span<int> x = new[] { 1,  2,  3,  4  };
Span<int> y = new[] { 10, 20, 30, 40 };
x[..2].CopyTo (y[2..]);                 // y is now { 10, 20, 1, 2 }
```
If thereâ€™s not enough space in the destination to complete the copy, CopyTo throws an exception, whereas TryCopyTo returns false (without copying any elements).

The span structs also expose methods to Clear and Fill the span as well as an IndexOf method to search for an element in the span.
