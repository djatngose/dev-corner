# what different between Span and Memory
Both Span<T> and Memory<T> are new types introduced in C# 7.2 for working with contiguous regions of memory in a safer and more efficient way.

`Span<T>` represents a contiguous region of arbitrary memory and provides a safe and efficient way to perform operations on the underlying memory. It is a `value type that can only be used with stack allocation`. It can be used to access and manipulate arrays, stackalloc'ed memory, or native memory allocated by unmanaged code.

`Memory<T>` is similar to `Span<T>`, but it is a `reference type that can be used with heap allocation`. It represents an owned memory block that can be resized or released when it's no longer needed. It provides additional methods for managing the lifetime of the memory block, such as Dispose, Pin, and Slice.

In summary
  - `Span<T>` is used when you `need to work with contiguous memory regions in a safe and efficient way, and you can allocate the memory on the stack or work with existing memory.`
  -  Memory<T> is `used when you need to manage the lifetime of memory blocks that are allocated on the heap and potentially resized or released.`


# Use cases 
Spans and Memories are commonly used when working with arrays or other contiguous blocks of memory, especially when high performance and low overhead are important.

`High-performance scenarios`: As mentioned earlier, Span and Memory can be used in performance-critical scenarios where avoiding memory allocations and reducing garbage collection overhead is crucial. For example, in ASP.NET Core pipeline, you can use Span and Memory to avoid allocating memory for request and response processing.

`Working with large data set`s: If you need to work with large data sets such as images, video frames, or audio streams, Span and Memory can help you to efficiently process and manipulate the data without having to make unnecessary copies.

`Parsing and serialization`: When parsing or serializing data, you can use Span and Memory to work with substrings of the input data without having to create a copy. This can be especially useful when dealing with large JSON or XML documents.

`Interoperability`: If you need to interface with unmanaged code, Span and Memory can be used to pass data back and forth between managed and unmanaged memory without having to create a copy of the data.

Here are some examples of when to use `Spans`:

  - You need to work with contiguous memory in a performance-sensitive way. Span<T> is particularly useful when dealing with large amounts of data, such as when processing audio or video streams, or when working with network protocols.
  - Parsing data from a large buffer of bytes, such as when reading from a socket or file
  - Working with strings or other character data, such as in text processing or parsing
  - Manipulating arrays or other contiguous blocks of memory, such as in graphics or numerical computations
  - Interacting with unmanaged code or APIs that work with memory pointers


And here are some examples of when to use `Memories`:

  - Use Memory<T> when you need to work with a block of memory that can be resized dynamically, such as when reading data from a file or network stream. Memory<T> provides a common interface for working with memory, whether it's stack-allocated, heap-allocated, or externally managed.
  - Reading or writing large blocks of data, such as when copying files or sending data over a network
  - Processing streams of data, such as audio or video
  - Implementing memory caches or pools, to avoid excessive memory allocations and deallocations
  - Interacting with unmanaged code or APIs that work with memory pointers, but with the added safety and convenience of managed memory management

In general, if you have a fixed block of memory that you need to work with, use Span<T>. If you need to work with a block of memory that can be resized or managed dynamically, use Memory<T>.

# When to use Span over Memory and vice versa?
Use `Span<T>` when:
  - You need to work with contiguous blocks of memory, and you want to manipulate the data directly in memory.
  - You need to work with unmanaged memory (e.g. from a native API).
  - You want to avoid heap allocations and improve performance in performance-critical code.
  - 
Use `Memory<T>` when:
  - You need to pass around a reference to a block of memory without actually manipulating the data in memory.
  - You need to access the length of the block of memory, or use some of the utility methods available on the Memory<T> type (e.g. Slice, Span, ToArray, etc.).
  - You need to support asynchronous operations or use Memory<T> as a field in a class.
