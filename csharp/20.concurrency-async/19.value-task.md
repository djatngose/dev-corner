# Value task
This is because `Task and Task<T>` are reference types, and so instantiation requires a heap-based memory allocation and subsequent collection. An extreme form of optimization is to write code that’s allocation-free; in other words, that does not instantiate any reference types, adding no burden to garbage collection. To support this pattern, the `ValueTask and ValueTask<T> structs `have been introduced, which the compiler allows in place of `Task and Task<T>:`

`ValueTask` can minimize context switching overhead by avoiding unnecessary allocation of heap memory for small and short-lived tasks. When an asynchronous operation completes synchronously, a ValueTask instance can be used to represent the result of that operation without allocating a new heap object for the Task instance.

In a typical asynchronous code, when an asynchronous operation completes synchronously, the runtime would create a new Task object to represent the completed task, then the calling code would await this new Task object. This process of allocating and awaiting a new Task object creates additional overhead due to the context switching required to allocate and free memory on the heap.

On the other hand, when an asynchronous operation completes synchronously, a `ValueTask` instance can represent the completed task without any heap allocation or context switching. The calling code can simply unwrap the result of the ValueTask using the Value property or the await operator, `without incurring any additional context switching overhead.`

```c#
public async Task<int> GetValueAsync()
{
    // Perform an asynchronous operation
    await Task.Delay(100);
    return 42;
}

```

When calling this method, if the asynchronous operation completes synchronously, the runtime would allocate a new Task<int> object to represent the completed task, which would create additional context switching overhead. However, by using ValueTask, the code can be rewritten as follows:

```c#
public async ValueTask<int> GetValueAsync()
{
    // Perform an asynchronous operation
    await Task.Delay(100);
    return 42;
}
```
With this change, if the asynchronous operation completes synchronously, a ValueTask<int> instance would represent the completed task without incurring any additional context switching overhead.

Overall, using ValueTask can reduce context switching overhead by avoiding unnecessary heap allocation and object creation, which can lead to faster and more efficient asynchronous code.
```c#
async ValueTask<int> Foo() { ... }
```
`Awaiting ValueTask<T> is allocation-free`, if the operation completes synchronously:
```c#
int answer = await Foo(); // (Potentially) allocation-free
```
If the operation doesn’t complete synchronously, ValueTask<T> creates an ordinary
Task<T> behind the scenes (to which it forwards the await), and nothing is gained. You can convert a ValueTask<T> into an ordinary Task<T> by calling the AsTask
method.
There’s also a nongeneric version—ValueTask—which is akin to Task.
# Precautions when using ValueTask<T>
ValueTask<T> is relatively unusual in that it’s defined as a struct purely for per‐ formance reasons. This means that it’s encumbered with inappropriate value-type semantics that can lead to surprises. To avoid incorrect behavior, you must avoid the following:
  -  `Awaiting the same ValueTask<T> multiple times`
  -  `Calling .GetAwaiter().GetResult() when the operation hasn’t completed`

 `ValueTask<T> `has value-type semantics, which means it behaves differently than reference types like classes. Specifically, when you assign a ValueTask<T> to a variable or pass it as a parameter, you are copying the entire struct, not just a reference to it. This can lead to surprises if you're not careful.

One potential issue with `ValueTask<T>` is that if you attempt to await it multiple times, you may get unexpected behavior. Since ValueTask<T> is a struct, `each await creates a new copy of the struct, and the state of the task may not be updated correctly. To avoid this, you should only await a ValueTask<T> once.`

Another potential issue is calling `.GetAwaiter().GetResult() on a ValueTask<T> before it has completed`. This can cause a blocking operation and potentially `deadlock` your application. To avoid this, you should always check the IsCompleted property or await the task instead of calling .GetAwaiter().GetResult().

In summary, while ValueTask<T> can provide performance benefits in certain scenarios, it requires careful usage to avoid unexpected behavior due to its value-type semantics.

The easiest way to avoid these traps is to directly await a method call, for instance:
```c#
await Foo(); // Safe
```
The door to erroneous behavior opens when you assign the (value) task to a variable:
```c#
ValueTask<int> valueTask = Foo(); // Caution! // Our use of valueTask can now lead to errors.
```
which can be mitigated by converting immediately to an ordi‐ nary task:
Task<int> task = Foo().AsTask(); // Safe // task is safe to work with.


Let's say you have the following Foo() method that returns a ValueTask<int>:

csharp
Copy code
public async ValueTask<int> FooAsync()
{
    await Task.Delay(100);
    return 42;
}
Now, let's say you have two methods that take a ValueTask<int> as a parameter:

```c#
public async Task<int> BarAsync(ValueTask<int> valueTask)
{
    int result = await valueTask;
    Console.WriteLine($"BarAsync result: {result}");
    return result;
}

public async Task<int> BazAsync(ValueTask<int> valueTask)
{
    int result = await valueTask;
    Console.WriteLine($"BazAsync result: {result}");
    return result;
}
```
Now, if you create a ValueTask<int> variable by calling FooAsync() and pass it to BarAsync() and BazAsync() like this:
```c#
ValueTask<int> valueTask = FooAsync();
Task<int> barTask = BarAsync(valueTask);
Task<int> bazTask = BazAsync(valueTask);
```
You will run into an error at runtime because valueTask is a struct and is copied when passed as a parameter, so barTask and bazTask are each awaiting a separate copy of the ValueTask<int> struct.

This can cause unexpected behavior because the two tasks are effectively racing to complete the same underlying asynchronous operation. Depending on the timing of the tasks, one of them might complete before the other, or they might both complete, but with different results.

To avoid this error, you `should only await a ValueTask<T> once or use a Task instead if you need to pass it around to multiple methods.`
