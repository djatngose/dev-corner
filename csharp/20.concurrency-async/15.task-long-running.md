# Long-running tasks
By default, the CLR runs tasks on pooled threads, which is ideal for short-running compute-bound work. For `longer-running` and blocking operations (such as our preceding example), you can prevent use of a pooled thread as follows:
```c#
Task task = Task.Factory.StartNew (() => ..., TaskCreationOptions.LongRunning);
```

 creates a task that will run on `a dedicated thread rather than using a thread from the thread pool`. `This is useful for long-running operations that block the thread, as it frees up the thread pool for other tasks.`

However, if multiple long-running tasks are run in parallel, it can lead to performance issues, as creating and managing multiple threads can be expensive. In such cases, there are better solutions to implement concurrency:

`For I/O bound tasks`, it's better to use TaskCompletionSource and asynchronous functions that use callbacks instead of threads. This avoids blocking threads and instead allows them to be reused for other tasks.

`For compute-bound tasks`, it's better to use a producer/consumer queue that throttles the concurrency for those tasks, avoiding starvation for other threads and processes. This approach ensures that the number of threads used for compute-bound tasks is limited and balanced with other tasks.

There are several options available in `TaskCreationOptions` enumeration, which can be used to control how a task is created and scheduled. Some commonly used options include:

`TaskCreationOptions.None`: This is the default option and indicates that the task can be scheduled on any available thread in the thread pool.

`TaskCreationOptions.LongRunning`: This option is used to create a task that is expected to have a long duration, such as an I/O operation or a compute-bound operation that may block the calling thread. When this option is used, the task scheduler may create a new thread instead of scheduling the task on an existing thread in the thread pool.

`TaskCreationOptions.PreferFairness`: This option is used to indicate that the task scheduler should try to distribute tasks fairly among all threads in the thread pool, rather than using a last-in, first-out (LIFO) order for scheduling tasks.

`TaskCreationOptions.AttachedToParent`: This option is used to create a child task that is attached to its parent task. When the parent task completes, the child task will also complete, regardless of whether it has finished executing or not.

`TaskCreationOptions.RunContinuationsAsynchronously`: This option is used to ensure that continuations (i.e., the code that executes after the task has completed) are run on a separate thread, rather than the thread that completed the task.

```c#
using System;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;

class Program
{
    static async Task Main()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"Main thread: {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}");

        Task<int> task = Task.Run(() =>
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"Task thread: {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}");
            Thread.Sleep(1000);
            return 42;
        }, TaskCreationOptions.RunContinuationsAsynchronously);

        int result = await task;

        Console.WriteLine($"Result: {result}, Main thread: {Thread.CurrentThread.ManagedThreadId}");
    }
}

```
