# State machine
Async/await is a feature in .NET that allows you to write asynchronous code that looks like synchronous code. When you use the async/await keywords, the compiler generates a state machine to manage the asynchronous code execution.

Here's how it works:

1. When you use the async keyword to define a method, the compiler generates a state machine for that method. The state machine is created as a class that implements the IAsyncStateMachine interface.

2. The state machine has several states, including the initial state, the await state, and the completion state. When the async method is called, the state machine starts in the initial state.

3. When the method encounters an await keyword, the state machine transitions to the await state. The await state represents the point in the code where the asynchronous operation is awaited. The state machine then suspends the method and returns control to the caller.

4. When the asynchronous operation completes, the state machine transitions back to the initial state and resumes executing the method.

5. The state machine uses a callback to notify the method when the asynchronous operation completes. When the callback is called, the state machine transitions back to the initial state and resumes executing the method.

Overall, async/await in .NET allows you to write asynchronous code in a way that is much easier to read and maintain than traditional asynchronous code using callbacks or other mechanisms. The state machine that is generated by the compiler takes care of managing the asynchronous operation and allows you to focus on the logical flow of your code.
