# WhenAny
`Task.WhenAny` returns a task that completes when any one of a set of tasks complete. The following completes in one second:
```c#
  Task<int> winningTask = await Task.WhenAny (Delay1(), Delay2(), Delay3());
    Console.WriteLine ("Done");
    Console.WriteLine (winningTask.Result);   // 1

 async Task<int> Delay1() { await Task.Delay (1000); return 1; }
    async Task<int> Delay2() { await Task.Delay (2000); return 2; }
    async Task<int> Delay3() { await Task.Delay (3000); return 3; }

```
Because Task.WhenAny itself returns a task, we await it, which returns the task that finished first. Our example is entirely nonblocking—including the last line when we access the Result property (because winningTask will already have finished). Nonetheless, it’s usually better to await the winningTask:
```c#
Console.WriteLine (await winningTask); // 1
```
because any exceptions are then rethrown without an AggregateException wrap‐
ping. In fact, we can perform both awaits in one step:
```c#
int answer = await await Task.WhenAny (Delay1(), Delay2(), Delay3());
```
