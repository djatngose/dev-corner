# Synchronization Contexts
In the System.ComponentModel namespace, there’s a class called Synchronization Context, which enables the generalization of thread marshaling.

In the System.ComponentModel namespace, there’s a class called Synchronization Context, which enables the generalization of thread marshaling.
The rich-client APIs for mobile and desktop (UWP, WPF, and Windows Forms) each define and instantiate SynchronizationContext subclasses, which you can obtain via the static property SynchronizationContext.Current (while running on a UI thread). Capturing this property lets you later “post” to UI controls from a worker thread:
```c#
partial class MyWindow : Window {
SynchronizationContext _uiSyncContext;
      public MyWindow()
      {
InitializeComponent();
// Capture the synchronization context for the current UI thread: _uiSyncContext = SynchronizationContext.Current;
new Thread (Work).Start();
}
void Work() {
Thread.Sleep (5000);
// Simulate time-consuming task
   UpdateMessage ("The answer");
      }
      void UpdateMessage (string message)
      {
        // Marshal the delegate to the UI thread:
        _uiSyncContext.Post (_ => txtMessage.Text = message, null);
} }
```

This is useful because the same technique works with all rich-client user interface APIs.
Calling Post is equivalent to calling BeginInvoke on a Dispatcher or Control; there’s also a Send method that is equivalent to Invoke.

For example, in a GUI application, the Synchronization Context ensures that UI updates are performed on the main UI thread. This is important because updating the UI from a background thread can cause errors and unpredictable behavior. By using the Synchronization Context, the application can ensure that all UI updates are performed on the main thread, even if the update is initiated from a background thread.

```c#
using System;
using System.Threading;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using System.Windows.Forms;

namespace SynchronizationContextExample
{
    public partial class Form1 : Form
    {
        public Form1()
        {
            InitializeComponent();
        }

        private void button1_Click(object sender, EventArgs e)
        {
            // Run a task on a background thread
            Task.Run(() =>
            {
                // Simulate some work
                Thread.Sleep(1000);

                // Update the UI on the main thread using the Synchronization Context
                SynchronizationContext.Post(new SendOrPostCallback((_) =>
                {
                    label1.Text = "Task completed";
                }), null);
            });
        }
    }
}

```
In this example, a Windows Forms application has a button that starts a task on a background thread when clicked. The task simulates some work by sleeping for 1 second, then updates the UI on the main thread by setting the label text to "Task completed".

The key part of this example is the use of the SynchronizationContext.Post method to post the update to the main thread. This ensures that the UI update is performed on the correct thread, even though it was initiated from a background thread.
