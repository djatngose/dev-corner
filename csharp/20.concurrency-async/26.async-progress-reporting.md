# Progress Reporting
Sometimes, you’ll want an asynchronous operation to report back progress as it’s running. A simple solution is to pass an Action delegate to the asynchronous method, which the method fires whenever progress changes:
```c#
Task Foo (Action<int> onProgressPercentChanged) {
      return Task.Run (() =>
      {
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
        {
          if (i % 10 == 0) onProgressPercentChanged (i / 10);
          // Do something compute-bound...
        }
}); }
```
Here’s how we could call it:
```c#
Action<int> progress = i => Console.WriteLine (i + " %"); await Foo (progress);
```
Although this works well in a console application, it’s not ideal in rich-client scenar‐ ios because it reports progress from a worker thread, causing potential thread-safety issues for the consumer. (In effect, we’ve allowed a side effect of concurrency to “leak” to the outside world, which is unfortunate given that the method is otherwise isolated if called from a UI thread.)

# IProgress<T> and Progress<T>
The CLR provides a pair of types to solve this problem: an interface called IProgress<T> and a class that implements this interface called Progress<T>. Their purpose, in effect, is to “wrap” a delegate so that UI applications can report progress safely through the synchronization context.

The interface defines just one method:
```c#
    public interface IProgress<in T>
    {
      void Report (T value);
    }
Using IProgress<T> is easy; our method hardly changes:
Task Foo (IProgress<int> onProgressPercentChanged) {
      return Task.Run (() =>
      {
        for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++)
        {
if (i % 10 == 0) onProgressPercentChanged.Report (i / 10);

          // Do something compute-bound...
        }
}); }
```
The Progress<T> class has a constructor that accepts a delegate of type Action<T> that it wraps:
var progress = new Progress<int> (i => Console.WriteLine (i + " %")); await Foo (progress);
(Progress<T> also has a ProgressChanged event that you can subscribe to instead of [or in addition to] passing an action delegate to the constructor.) Upon instantiating Progress<int>, the class captures the synchronization context, if present. When Foo then calls Report, the delegate is invoked through that context.
