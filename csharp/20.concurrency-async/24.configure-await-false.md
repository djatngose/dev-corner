# Avoiding excessive bouncing
For methods that are called many times in a loop, you can avoid the cost of repeatedly bouncing to a UI message loop by calling ConfigureAwait. This forces a task not to bounce continuations to the synchronization context, cutting the overhead closer to the cost of a context switch (or much less if the method that you’re awaiting completes synchronously):

```c#
async void A() { ... await B(); ... }
async Task B() {
for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) await C().ConfigureAwait (false);
    }
    async Task C() { ... }
```
This means that for the B and C methods, we rescind the simple thread-safety model in UI apps whereby code runs on the UI thread and can be preempted only during an await statement. Method A, however, is unaffected and will remain on a UI thread if it started on one.
This optimization is particularly relevant when writing libraries: you don’t need the benefit of simplified thread-safety because your code typically does not share state with the caller—and does not access UI controls. (It would also make sense, in our example, for method C to complete synchronously if it knew the operation was likely to be short-running.)

In the code example you provided, there is a loop that `calls the C() method 1000 times`. Since this loop is called many times in a loop, it can be beneficial to use ConfigureAwait(false) when await-ing the `C()` method. This will cause the continuation of the `C()` task to execute on a thread pool thread, rather than bouncing back to the UI message loop, which can be expensive in terms of performance.
