# Tasks
`A thread is a low-level tool for creating concurrency`, and as such, it has limitations, particularly the following:
  • Although it’s easy to pass data into a thread that you start, there’s no easy way to get a “return value” back from a thread that you Join. You need to set up some kind of shared field. And if the operation throws an exception, catching and propagating that exception is equally painful.
  • You can’t tell a thread to start something else when it’s finished; instead you must Join it (blocking your own thread in the process).

`These limitations discourage fine-grained concurrency`; in other words, they make it difficult to compose larger concurrent operations by combining smaller ones (something essential for the asynchronous programming that we look at in follow‐ ing sections). This in turn leads to greater reliance on manual synchronization (locking, signaling, and so on) and the problems that go with it.

The direct use of threads also has performance implications that we discussed in “The Thread Pool” on page 624. And should you need to `run hundreds or thousands of concurrent I/O-bound operations, a thread-based approach consumes hundreds or thousands of megabytes of memory purely in thread overhead.`


The `Task` class helps with all of these problems. Compared to a thread, a Task is `higher-level abstraction—it represents a concurrent operation that might or might not be backed by a thread.`

`Tasks` are `compositional` (`you can chain them together through the use of continuations`). They can use the thread pool to lessen startup latency, and with a TaskCompletionSource,

`they can employ a callback approach that avoids threads altogether while waiting on I/O-bound operations.`

# Task vs thread
`Abstraction level`: A `task` is a higher-level abstraction than a thread. A task represents a unit of work that can be scheduled and executed by a thread from a thread pool. It provides a simplified programming model for asynchronous operations, making it easier to write code that runs asynchronously without dealing with low-level threading details. A `thread`, on the other hand, is a lower-level abstraction that represents an independent path of execution that can be scheduled by the operating system.

`Resource usage`: Using `tasks` is generally more efficient than using threads because tasks can be executed on threads from a thread pool, which reduces the overhead of creating and destroying threads. `Threads`, on the other hand, are more expensive to create and maintain, and can consume more system resources.

`Synchronization`: `Tasks` can be synchronized using higher-level constructs like async/await or the Task Parallel Library (TPL), which provides a more granular and flexible way to manage concurrency. `Threads` require lower-level synchronization mechanisms like locks and semaphores, which can be more difficult to use correctly and efficiently.

`Error handling`: `Tasks` provide better error handling than threads. When an exception is thrown in a task, it can be caught and handled within the task, or propagated to the calling code using the Task.Exception property. With `threads`, exceptions can be harder to handle and can cause the entire process to crash if not caught.

Overall, `tasks` are a higher-level abstraction that provide a simpler, more efficient, and more flexible way to perform asynchronous and parallel operations in C#. However, `threads` are still useful for low-level synchronization and control, and for cases where fine-grained control over the scheduling and execution of code is required.

# Starting a Task
The easiest way to start a Task backed by a thread is with the static method Task.Run (the Task class is in the System.Threading.Tasks namespace). Simply pass in an Action delegate:
```c#
    Task.Run (() => Console.WriteLine ("Foo"));
```
`Tasks use pooled threads by default, which are background threads`. This means that when the main thread ends, so do any tasks that you create. Hence, to run these examples from a console application, you must block the main thread after starting the task (for instance, by Waiting the task or by call‐ ing Console.ReadLine):
```c#
Task.Run (() => Console.WriteLine ("Foo")); Console.ReadLine();
```
Calling `Task.Run` in this manner is similar to starting a `thread` as follows (except for the thread pooling implications that we discuss shortly):
```c#
    new Thread (() => Console.WriteLine ("Foo")).Start();
```
Task.Run returns a Task object that we can use to monitor its progress, rather like a Thread object. (Notice, however, that we didn’t call Start after calling Task.Run because this method creates “hot” tasks; you can instead use Task’s constructor to create “cold” tasks, although this is rarely done in practice.)
You can track a task’s execution status via its Status property.

`a "hot" task` is one that is already scheduled to run on a thread pool thread. When you call Task.Run, it schedules the task for execution on a thread pool thread as soon as one is available, so it is a hot task.

On the other hand, `a "cold" task `is one that has been created but not yet scheduled for execution. You can create a cold task by using the Task constructor without passing a delegate, like this:
```c#
Task t = new Task();
```
`Cold tasks` can be useful in certain scenarios, such as when you want to pass a task around as a parameter or return value, but defer its execution until later.

# Wait
Calling `Wait` on a task `blocks until it completes and is the equivalent of calling Join on a thread`:
```c#
    Task task = Task.Run (() =>
    {
      Thread.Sleep (2000);
      Console.WriteLine ("Foo");
    });
    Console.WriteLine (task.IsCompleted);  // False
    task.Wait();  // Blocks until task is complete
```
Wait lets you optionally specify a timeout and a cancellation token to end the wait early

# task.Wait() is block the main thread?
`Yes`, task.Wait() blocks the main thread until the task completes. The Wait() method waits for the task to complete execution and returns the result. If the task has already completed, then Wait() returns immediately. However, if the task is still running, Wait() blocks the calling thread until the task completes. In this case, it will block the main thread because it is the thread that is executing the Wait() method.

# When I use await ,it it blocked thread?
No, when you use `await`, it does not block the thread. Instead, it frees up the thread to do other work while waiting for the awaited operation to complete. When the awaited operation is complete, it resumes execution of the method that called await. This is what is known as "asynchronous" programming, and it is a key feature of the Task Parallel Library in C#.

When you use `await`, the compiler generates code that creates a s`tate machine `that captures the context of the calling method. This context is used to resume execution of the method when the awaited operation is complete. The context can include things like the synchronization context, which controls how callbacks are executed, and any variables that were in scope when the method was called.

Overall, using await is a powerful way to write asynchronous code in C# that is efficient and easy to read. It allows you to write code that is non-blocking and responsive, while still being able to take advantage of the full power of the .NET Framework.

# Task.CompletedTask
Task.CompletedTask is a pre-completed task that is returned when a method is expected to return a Task but doesn't actually have any asynchronous operations to perform. It is a static property of the Task class that returns a Task instance in the completed state, with a result of null.

Using Task.CompletedTask instead of creating a new Task instance can improve performance by reducing unnecessary allocations and reducing the overhead of scheduling and managing the task. It is often used as the return value for asynchronous methods that don't actually have any asynchronous work to perform, such as simple property accessors or methods that perform synchronous operations.
```c#
public async Task<int> GetValueAsync()
{
    if (someCondition)
        return Task.CompletedTask;

    int value = await GetSomeValueAsync();
    return value * 2;
}

```

# Returning values
Task has a generic subclass called Task<TResult>, which allows a task to emit a return value. You can obtain a Task<TResult> by calling Task.Run with a Func <TResult> delegate (or a compatible lambda expression) instead of an Action:
```c#
Task<int> task = Task.Run (() => { Console.WriteLine ("Foo"); return 3; }); // ...
```
You can obtain the result later by querying the Result property. If the task hasn’t yet finished, accessing this property will block the current thread until the task finishes:
```c#
int result = task.Result; // Blocks if not already finished Console.WriteLine (result); // 3
```
In the following example, we create a task that uses LINQ to count the number of prime numbers in the first three million (+2) integers:
```c#
Task<int> primeNumberTask = Task.Run (() => Enumerable.Range (2, 3000000).Count (n =>
        Enumerable.Range (2, (int)Math.Sqrt(n)-1).All (i => n % i > 0)));
    Console.WriteLine ("Task running...");
    Console.WriteLine ("The answer is " + primeNumberTask.Result);
```
This writes “Task running...” and then a few seconds later writes the answer of 216816.
`Task<TResult>` can be thought of as a “future,” in that it encapsulates a Result that becomes available later in time.

# Exceptions
Unlike with threads, tasks conveniently propagate exceptions. So, if the code in your task throws an unhandled exception (in other words, if your task faults), that exception is automatically rethrown to whoever calls `Wait()`—or accesses the Result property of a Task<TResult>:
```c#
// Start a Task that throws a NullReferenceException:
    Task task = Task.Run (() => { throw null; });
    try
    {
      task.Wait();
    }
catch (AggregateException aex) {
  if (aex.InnerException is NullReferenceException) Console.WriteLine ("Null!");
  else throw;
}
```
(The CLR wraps the exception in an AggregateException in order to play well with
parallel programming scenarios; we discuss this in Chapter 22.)
You can test for a faulted task without rethrowing the exception via the IsFaulted and IsCanceled properties of the Task. If both properties return false, no error occurred; if IsCanceled is true, an OperationCanceledException was thrown for that task (see “Cancellation” on page 918); if IsFaulted is true, another type of exception was thrown, and the Exception property will indicate the error.

# Exceptions and autonomous tasks
With autonomous “set-and-forget” tasks (those for which you don’t rendezvous via Wait() or Result, or a continuation that does the same), it’s good practice to explicitly exception-handle the task code to avoid silent failure, just as you would with a thread.

Ignoring exceptions is fine when an exception solely indicates a failure to obtain a result that you’re no longer interested in. For example, if a user cancels a request to download a web page, we wouldn’t care if it turns out that the web page didn’t exist.
`Ignoring exceptions is problematic` when an exception indi‐ cates a bug in your program, for two reasons:
• The bug may have left your program in an invalid state.
• More exceptions may occur later as a result of the bug, and failure to log the initial error can make diagnosis difficult.

You can `subscribe to unobserved exceptions at a global level via the static event TaskScheduler.UnobservedTaskException`; handling this event and logging the error can make good sense.

There are a couple of interesting nuances on what counts as unobserved:
• Tasks waited upon with a timeout will generate an unobserved exception if the
fault occurs after the timeout interval.
• The act of checking a task’s Exception property after it has faulted makes the
exception “observed.”
