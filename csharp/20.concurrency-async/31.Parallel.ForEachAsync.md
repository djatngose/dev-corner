# Parallel.ForEachAsync
From .NET 6, another approach to limit asynchronous concurrency is to use the Parallel.ForEachAsync method. Assuming uris in an array of URIs that you wish to download, hereâ€™s how to download them in parallel, while limiting the concurrency to a maximum of 10 parallel downloads:
await Parallel.ForEachAsync (uris,
new ParallelOptions { MaxDegreeOfParallelism = 10 }, async (uri, cancelToken) =>
       {
        var download = await new HttpClient().GetByteArrayAsync (uri);
        Console.WriteLine ($"Downloaded {download.Length} bytes");
});
The other methods in the Parallel class are intended for (compute-bound) parallel programming scenarios, which we describe in Chapter 22.
