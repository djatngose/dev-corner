# Static members
Wrapping access to an object around a custom lock works only if all concurrent threads are aware of—and use—the lock. This might not be the case if the object is widely scoped. The worst case is with static members in a public type. For instance, imagine if the static property on the DateTime struct, DateTime.Now, was not thread-safe and that two concurrent calls could result in garbled output or an exception.

The only way to remedy this with external locking might be to lock the type itself—lock(typeof(DateTime))—before calling DateTime.Now. This would work only if all programmers agreed to do this (which is unlikely). Furthermore, locking a type creates problems of its own.

For this reason, static members on the DateTime struct have been carefully pro‐ grammed to be thread-safe. This is a common pattern throughout .NET: static members are thread-safe; instance members are not. Following this pattern also makes sense when writing types for public consumption, so as not to create impossible thread-safety conundrums. In other words, by making static methods thread-safe, you’re programming so as not to preclude thread safety for consumers of that type.

Note: Thread safety in static methods is something that you must explicitly code: it doesn’t happen automatically by virtue of the method being static!

# Thread-safe static methods: Static methods that do not modify any shared state and only operate on their input parameters are inherently thread-safe.
The author is referring to the common pattern throughout .NET where static methods are designed to be thread-safe. This means that multiple threads can call the static method simultaneously without causing data corruption or other unexpected behavior.

Here are some examples of thread-safe static methods in .NET:

`Math.Sqrt `method: This method is a static method of the Math class in .NET, and it is thread-safe. Multiple threads can call this method at the same time without any issues.

`DateTime.UtcNow` method: This method is a static method of the DateTime struct in .NET, and it is also thread-safe. Multiple threads can call this method to get the current UTC time without any issues.

`String.IsNullOrEmpty` method: This method is a static method of the String class in .NET, and it is thread-safe as well. Multiple threads can call this method to check if a string is null or empty without any issues.

`Math.Max(), Math.Min()`: methods in the System namespace for performing mathematical operations.
Console.WriteLine(): method in the System namespace for writing to the console output.
`File.ReadAllText()`, File.WriteAllText(): methods in the System.IO namespace for reading from and writing to files.
`DateTime.Now`: a property in the System namespace for getting the current date and time.
`Enumerable.Range():` a method in the System.Linq namespace for creating a sequence of integers.
`String.Join():` a method in the System namespace for concatenating strings with a delimiter.
`Convert.ToInt32()`: a method in the System namespace for converting a value to an integer.
`Regex.Match(),` Regex.Replace(): methods in the System.Text.RegularExpressions namespace for working with regular expressions.
`HttpClient.GetAsync(),` HttpClient.PostAsync(): methods in the System.Net.Http namespace for sending HTTP requests.
`JsonConvert.SerializeObject(), JsonConvert.DeserializeObject()`: methods in the Newtonsoft.Json namespace for serializing and deserializing JSON data.

These are just a few examples of thread-safe static methods in .NET. In general, any static method that does not access shared state or modify global variables should be thread-safe.
