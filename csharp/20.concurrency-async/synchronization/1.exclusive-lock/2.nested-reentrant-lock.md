# Nested Locking
A thread can repeatedly lock the same object in a nested (reentrant) fashion:
```c#
    lock (locker)
      lock (locker)
        lock (locker)
        {
           // Do something...
        }
 ```       
Alternatively:
```c#
Monitor.Enter (locker); Monitor.Enter (locker); Monitor.Enter (locker); // Do something...
Monitor.Exit (locker); Monitor.Exit (locker); Monitor.Exit (locker);
```
`In these scenarios, the object is unlocked only when the outermost lock statement has exitedâ€”or a matching number of Monitor.Exit statements have executed.`
Nested locking is useful when one method calls another from within a lock:
```c#
object locker = new object();
lock (locker)
{
  AnotherMethod();
  // We still have the lock - because locks are reentrant.
}
void AnotherMethod()
{
  lock (locker) { Console.WriteLine ("Another method"); } 
}
```

In the example I provided, it may not be strictly necessary to lock the same object in AnotherMethod() if it is guaranteed that the method will only be called from within the synchronized block of the outer method.

However, there are some reasons why we might still choose to use the same lock object in AnotherMethod():

`Code clarity`: By using the same lock object throughout our code, we make it clear that the two methods are synchronizing access to the same shared resource. This can make the code easier to understand and maintain, especially for other developers who may be working on the same codebase.

`Flexibility`: If we later decide to call AnotherMethod() from outside the synchronized block of the outer method, using the same lock object ensures that access to the shared resource is still synchronized correctly. This can be particularly useful if the codebase evolves over time and new requirements arise.

`Avoiding potential issues`: While it may not be strictly necessary to use the same lock object in AnotherMethod(), using a different lock object could potentially introduce synchronization issues if the method is called from outside the synchronized block of the outer method. By using the same lock object, we ensure that we don't accidentally introduce such issues into our code.
