# Thread-Local Storage
Much of this chapter has focused on synchronization constructs and the issues aris‐ ing from having threads concurrently access the same data. Sometimes, however, you want to keep data isolated, ensuring that each thread has a separate copy. Local variables achieve exactly this, but they are useful only with transient data.
The solution is thread-local storage. You might be hard-pressed to think of a require‐ ment: data you’d want to keep isolated to a thread tends to be transient by nature. Its main application is for storing “out-of-band” data—that which supports the execution path’s infrastructure, such as messaging, transaction, and security tokens. Passing such data around in method parameters can be clumsy and can alienate all but your own methods; storing such information in ordinary static fields means sharing it among all threads.
Thread-local storage can also be useful in optimizing parallel code. It allows each thread to exclusively access its own version of a thread-unsafe object without need‐ ing locks—and without needing to reconstruct that object between method calls.
There are four ways to implement thread-local storage. We take a look at them in the following subsections.

Thread-Local Storage (TLS) is used when you need to store and access data that is unique to a particular thread. This can be useful in multithreaded applications where different threads need access to thread-specific data.

One common use case for TLS is in web applications where each incoming request is typically processed by a new thread from a thread pool. If you have data that needs to be accessed and modified during the processing of the request, but that data should not be shared across threads, then you can use TLS to store that data in a way that is local to the thread.

Another use case for TLS is in GUI applications where different threads are responsible for different parts of the UI. If you have data that needs to be accessed and modified by a particular thread, but should not be shared with other threads, then you can use TLS to store that data.

TLS can be implemented using the ThreadLocal<T> class in .NET, which allows you to create thread-local variables that are stored separately for each thread. When a new thread is created, it gets its own copy of the thread-local variable, and modifications made to the variable by one thread do not affect the values seen by other threads

# [ThreadStatic]
The easiest approach to thread-local storage is to mark a static field with the ThreadStatic attribute:
[ThreadStatic] static int _x;
Each thread then sees a separate copy of _x.
Unfortunately, [ThreadStatic] doesn’t work with instance fields (it simply does nothing); nor does it play well with field initializers—they execute only once on the thread that’s running when the static constructor executes. If you need to work with instance fields—or start with a nondefault value—ThreadLocal<T> provides a better option.

# ThreadLocal<T>
ThreadLocal<T> provides thread-local storage for both static and instance fields, and allows you to specify default values.
Here’s how to create a ThreadLocal<int> with a default value of 3 for each thread: static ThreadLocal<int> _x = new ThreadLocal<int> (() => 3);
You then use _x’s Value property to get or set its thread-local value. A bonus of using ThreadLocal is that values are lazily evaluated: the factory function evaluates on the first call (for each thread).

# ThreadLocal<T> and instance fields
ThreadLocal<T> is also useful with instance fields and captured local variables. For example, consider the problem of generating random numbers in a multithreaded environment. The Random class is not thread-safe, so we have to either lock around using Random (limiting concurrency) or generate a separate Random object for each thread. ThreadLocal<T> makes the latter easy:
var localRandom = new ThreadLocal<Random>(() => new Random()); Console.WriteLine (localRandom.Value.Next());
Our factory function for creating the Random object is a bit simplistic, though, in that Random’s parameterless constructor relies on the system clock for a random number seed. This may be the same for two Random objects created within ~10 ms of each other. Here’s one way to fix it:
    var localRandom = new ThreadLocal<Random>
     ( () => new Random (Guid.NewGuid().GetHashCode()) );
We use this in Chapter 22 (see the parallel spellchecking example in “PLINQ” on page 911).

# AsyncLocal<T>
The approaches to thread-local storage that we’ve discussed so far are incompatible with asynchronous functions, because after an await, execution can resume on a different thread. The AsyncLocal<T> class solves this by preserving its value across an await:
static AsyncLocal<string> _asyncLocalTest = new AsyncLocal<string>();
    async void Main()
    {
_asyncLocalTest.Value = "test";
await Task.Delay (1000);
// The following works even if we come back on another thread: Console.WriteLine (_asyncLocalTest.Value); // test
}
AsyncLocal<T> is still able to keep operations started on separate threads apart, whether initiated by Thread.Start or Task.Run. The following writes “one one” and “two two”:

static AsyncLocal<string> _asyncLocalTest = new AsyncLocal<string>();
void Main() {
      // Call Test twice on two concurrent threads:
      new Thread (() => Test ("one")).Start();
      new Thread (() => Test ("two")).Start();
}
    async void Test (string value)
    {
      _asyncLocalTest.Value = value;
      await Task.Delay (1000);
      Console.WriteLine (value + " " + _asyncLocalTest.Value);
}
AsyncLocal<T> has an interesting and unique nuance: if an AsyncLocal<T> object
already has a value when a thread is started, the new thread will “inherit” that value:
    static AsyncLocal<string> _asyncLocalTest = new AsyncLocal<string>();
void Main() {
_asyncLocalTest.Value = "test";
      new Thread (AnotherMethod).Start();
    }
void AnotherMethod() => Console.WriteLine (_asyncLocalTest.Value); // test The new thread, however, gets a copy of the value, so any changes that it makes will
not affect the original:
    static AsyncLocal<string> _asyncLocalTest = new AsyncLocal<string>();
void Main() {
_asyncLocalTest.Value = "test";
var t = new Thread (AnotherMethod); t.Start(); t.Join();
Console.WriteLine (_asyncLocalTest.Value);
// test (not ha-ha!) void AnotherMethod() => _asyncLocalTest.Value = "ha-ha!";
}
Keep in mind that the new thread gets a shallow copy of the value. So, if you were to replace Async<string> with Async<StringBuilder> or Async<List<string>>, the new thread could clear the StringBuilder or add/remove items to the List<string>, and this would affect the original.

# Here are a few examples of real-life use cases for TLS:

Caching: When performing operations that are expensive to compute, it can be useful to cache the results to improve performance. However, if the cache is shared across threads, it can introduce synchronization issues. By using thread-local storage, each thread can have its own cache, eliminating the need for synchronization.

Logging: In a multi-threaded application, logging can become a bottleneck if all threads are writing to the same log file. By using thread-local storage, each thread can have its own log buffer, which can be periodically flushed to the log file by a single thread.

Contextual information: In some applications, it may be necessary to store contextual information on a per-thread basis. For example, in a web application, each thread may need access to information about the current user session. By using thread-local storage, this information can be stored on a per-thread basis, allowing each thread to access its own session information.

Performance counters: In performance-sensitive applications, it can be useful to track performance metrics on a per-thread basis. By using thread-local storage, each thread can update its own performance counters without the need for synchronization with other threads.
