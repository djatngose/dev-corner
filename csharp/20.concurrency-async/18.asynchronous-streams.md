With yield return, you can write an iterator; with await, you can write an asyn‚Äê chronous function. Asynchronous streams (from C# 8) combine these concepts and let you write an iterator that awaits, yielding elements asynchronously. This support builds on the following pair of interfaces, which are asynchronous counterparts to the enumeration interfaces
