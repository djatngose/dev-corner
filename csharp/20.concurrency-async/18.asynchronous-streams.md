# Asynchronous Streams
With yield return, you can write an iterator; with await, you can write an asyn‐ chronous function. Asynchronous streams (from C# 8) combine these concepts and let you write an iterator that awaits, yielding elements asynchronously. This support builds on the following pair of interfaces, which are asynchronous counterparts to the enumeration interfaces 
```c#
 public interface IAsyncEnumerable<out T>
    {
      IAsyncEnumerator<T> GetAsyncEnumerator (...);
    }
    public interface IAsyncEnumerator<out T>: IAsyncDisposable
    {
      T Current { get; }
      ValueTask<bool> MoveNextAsync();
    }
```

`ValueTask`<T> is a struct that wraps Task<T> and is behaviorally similar to Task<T> while enabling more efficient execution when the task completes synchronously (which can happen often when enumerating a sequence).
`IAsyncDisposable` is an asynchronous version of `IDisposable`; it provides an opportunity to perform cleanup should you choose to manually implement the interfaces:

The act of fetching each element from the sequence (Move NextAsync) is an asynchronous operation, so asynchronous streams are suitable when elements arrive in a piecemeal fashion (such as when processing data from a video stream). In contrast, the following type is more suitable when the sequence as a whole is delayed, but the elements, when they arrive, arrive all together:
Task<IEnumerable<T>>

To generate an asynchronous stream, you write a method that combines the princi‐ ples of iterators and asynchronous methods. In other words, your method should include both yield return and await, and it should return IAsyncEnumerable<T>:
```c#
async IAsyncEnumerable<int> RangeAsync ( int start, int count, int delay)
    {
      for (int i = start; i < start + count; i++)
      {
await Task.Delay (delay);
yield return i; }
}

```

To consume an asynchronous stream, use the await foreach statement:
await foreach (var number in RangeAsync (0, 10, 500)) Console.WriteLine (number);

Note that data arrives steadily, every 500 milliseconds (or, in real life, as it becomes available). Contrast this to a similar construct using Task<IEnumerable<T>> for which no data is returned until the last piece of data is available:
```c#
    static async Task<IEnumerable<int>> RangeTaskAsync (int start, int count,
                                                        int delay)
    {
      List<int> data = new List<int>();
      for (int i = start; i < start + count; i++)
      {
await Task.Delay (delay);
        data.Add (i);
      }
return data; }
```
Here’s how to consume it with the foreach statement: foreach (var data in await RangeTaskAsync(0, 10, 500))
      Console.WriteLine (data);
