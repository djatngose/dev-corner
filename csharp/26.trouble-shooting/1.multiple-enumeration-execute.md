# Possible multiple enumeration of IEnumerable
Consider the following code snippet:
```c#
IEnumerable<string> names = GetNames();
foreach (var name in names)
    Console.WriteLine("Found " + name);
var allNames = new StringBuilder();
foreach (var name in names)
    allNames.Append(name + " ");
```
Assuming that GetNames() returns an IEnumerable<string>, we are, effectively, doing extra work by enumerating this collection twice in the two foreach statements.

`It could get even worse if GetNames() results in a database query`, `in which case you could end up getting different values in both foreach loops if some other process changes the database between the two calls.`

This kind of problem can be easily fixed â€” force the enumeration at the point of variable initialization by converting the sequence to an array or a list, for example:

List<string> names = GetNames().ToList();
The rest of your code can stay the same, because both array and list types implement the IEnumerable interface.
