# BufferedStream
BufferedStream decorates, or wraps, another stream with buffering capability, and it is one of a number of decorator stream types in the .NET

When you read from or write to a stream, data is transferred in small chunks called "buffers." Reading or writing in small chunks can result in inefficient I/O operations, especially when dealing with large files or network data transfers. BufferedStream solves this problem by buffering the data into larger chunks, reducing the number of I/O operations needed.

BufferedStream works by creating an in-memory buffer that holds a portion of the data read from or written to the underlying stream. When you read from or write to a BufferedStream, the data is read or written to the buffer first, and then the buffer is flushed to the underlying stream when it becomes full.

You should use BufferedStream when you need to improve the performance of file or network I/O operations. For example, if you are reading a large file, wrapping the file stream with a BufferedStream can significantly reduce the number of I/O operations needed, resulting in faster performance.

It is important to note that BufferedStream should not be used in scenarios where data consistency is critical, such as when writing to a database or performing encryption or decryption operations. In these scenarios, you should use the underlying stream directly or use a more specialized stream class that provides data consistency guarantees.

`Buffering` improves performance by reducing round trips to the backing store. Hereâ€™s how we wrap a FileStream in a 20 KB BufferedStream:
```c#
    // Write 100K to a file:
    File.WriteAllBytes ("myFile.bin", new byte [100000]);
    using FileStream fs = File.OpenRead ("myFile.bin");
    using BufferedStream bs = new BufferedStream (fs, 20000);  //20K buffer
    bs.ReadByte();
    Console.WriteLine (fs.Position);         // 20000
```

Suppose you want to write a large amount of data to a file using a FileStream. Without buffering, the code might look like this:

```c#
using (var stream = new FileStream("example.txt", FileMode.Create))
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++)
    {
        byte[] buffer = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes($"Line {i}\n");
        stream.Write(buffer, 0, buffer.Length);
    }
}
```
In this case, the Write method is called for every line of data, which can be slow due to the overhead of accessing the file system for each call. By using a BufferedStream, we can write the data in larger chunks to the file system, which can be more efficient. Here's the same code using a BufferedStream:

```c#
using (var stream = new FileStream("example.txt", FileMode.Create))
using (var bufferedStream = new BufferedStream(stream))
{
    for (int i = 0; i < 1000000; i++)
    {
        byte[] buffer = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes($"Line {i}\n");
        bufferedStream.Write(buffer, 0, buffer.Length);
    }
}
```
In this case, the Write method is called on the BufferedStream, which internally writes to the underlying FileStream in larger chunks, resulting in fewer calls to the file system and potentially better performance.
