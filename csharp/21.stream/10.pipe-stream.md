# PipeStream
A PipeStream is a type of stream that provides a mechanism for interprocess communication (IPC) between two processes running on the same machine. It allows for the creation of a unidirectional or bidirectional communication channel using pipes.

PipeStream is useful when you have two processes that need to communicate with each other in real-time, without the overhead of writing and reading to a file. It can be used for scenarios such as passing large amounts of data between two processes, or for real-time streaming of data such as audio or video.

One common use case for PipeStream is in Windows Communication Foundation (WCF) services, where it can be used to pass messages between clients and the server. Another example is in PowerShell, where PipeStream is used to pipe data between cmdlets.

Overall, PipeStream is a powerful and flexible tool for interprocess communication and can be useful in a wide range of scenarios where two processes need to communicate with each other.

PipeStream provides a simple means by which one process can communicate with another through the operating system’s pipes protocol. There are two kinds of pipe:
`Anonymous pipe (faster)`
Allows one-way communication between a parent and child process on the same computer
`Named pipe (more flexible)`
Allows two-way communication between arbitrary processes on the same com‐ puter or different computers across a network
A pipe is good for interprocess communication (IPC) on a single computer: it doesn’t rely on a network transport, which means no network protocol overhead, and it has no issues with firewalls.

PipeStream is an abstract class with four concrete subtypes. Two are used for anonymous pipes and the other two for named pipes:
Anonymous pipes
AnonymousPipeServerStream and AnonymousPipeClientStream Named pipes
NamedPipeServerStream and NamedPipeClientStream Named pipes are simpler to use, so we describe them first.

# Named pipes
With named pipes, the parties communicate through a pipe of the same name. The protocol defines two distinct roles: the client and server. Communication happens between the client and server as follows:
• The server instantiates a NamedPipeServerStream and then calls WaitFor Connection.
• The client instantiates a NamedPipeClientStream and then calls Connect (with an optional timeout).
The two parties then read and write the streams to communicate.
The following example demonstrates a server that sends a single byte (100) and then waits to receive a single byte:
    using var s = new NamedPipeServerStream ("pipedream");
    s.WaitForConnection();
    s.WriteByte (100);                // Send the value 100.
    Console.WriteLine (s.ReadByte());
Here’s the corresponding client code:
    using var s = new NamedPipeClientStream ("pipedream");
s.Connect();
Console.WriteLine (s.ReadByte());
s.WriteByte (200); // Send the value 200 back.
Named pipe streams are bidirectional by default, so either party can read or write their stream. This means that the client and server must agree on some protocol to coordinate their actions, so both parties don’t end up sending or receiving at once.
There also needs to be agreement on the length of each transmission. Our example was trivial in this regard, because we bounced just a single byte in each direction. To help with messages longer than one byte, pipes provide a message transmission mode (Windows only). If this is enabled, a party calling Read can know when a message is complete by checking the IsMessageComplete property. To demonstrate, we begin by writing a helper method that reads a whole message from a message- enabled PipeStream—in other words, reads until IsMessageComplete is true:
    static byte[] ReadMessage (PipeStream s)
    {
      MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream();
      byte[] buffer = new byte [0x1000];      // Read in 4 KB blocks
do { ms.Write (buffer, 0, s.Read (buffer, 0, buffer.Length)); } while (!s.IsMessageComplete);
      return ms.ToArray();
    }

You cannot determine whether a PipeStream has finished reading a message simply by waiting for Read to return 0. This is because, unlike most other stream types, pipe streams and network streams have no definite end. Instead, they temporar‐ ily “dry up” between message transmissions.
Now we can activate message transmission mode. On the server, this is done by specifying PipeTransmissionMode.Message when constructing the stream:
using var s = new NamedPipeServerStream ("pipedream", PipeDirection.InOut, 1, PipeTransmissionMode.Message);
    s.WaitForConnection();
byte[] msg = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes ("Hello"); s.Write (msg, 0, msg.Length);
Console.WriteLine (Encoding.UTF8.GetString (ReadMessage (s)));
On the client, we activate message transmission mode by setting ReadMode after
calling Connect:
using var s = new NamedPipeClientStream ("pipedream");
    s.Connect();
    s.ReadMode = PipeTransmissionMode.Message;
    Console.WriteLine (Encoding.UTF8.GetString (ReadMessage (s)));
byte[] msg = Encoding.UTF8.GetBytes ("Hello right back!"); s.Write (msg, 0, msg.Length);
Message mode is supported only on Windows. Other plat‐ forms throw PlatformNotSupportedException.

# Anonymous pipes
An anonymous pipe provides a one-way communication stream between a parent and child process. Instead of using a system-wide name, anonymous pipes tune in through a private handle.
As with named pipes, there are distinct client and server roles. The system of communication is a little different, however, and proceeds as follows:
1. The server instantiates an AnonymousPipeServerStream, committing to a Pipe Direction of In or Out.
2. The server calls GetClientHandleAsString to obtain an identifier for the pipe, which it then passes to the client (typically as an argument when starting the child process).

The child process instantiates an AnonymousPipeClientStream, specifying the opposite PipeDirection.
4. The server releases the local handle that was generated in Step 2, by calling DisposeLocalCopyOfClientHandle.
5. The parent and child processes communicate by reading/writing the stream.
Because anonymous pipes are unidirectional, a server must create two pipes for bidirectional communication. The following Console program creates two pipes (input and output) and then starts up a child process. It then sends a single byte to the child process and receives a single byte in return:
    class Program
    {
      static void Main (string[] args)
      {
        if (args.Length == 0)
          // No arguments signals server mode
          AnonymousPipeServer();
        else
          // We pass in the pipe handle IDs as arguments to signal client mode
          AnonymousPipeClient (args [0], args [1]);
}
      static void AnonymousPipeClient (string rxID, string txID)
      {
        using (var rx = new AnonymousPipeClientStream (PipeDirection.In, rxID))
        using (var tx = new AnonymousPipeClientStream (PipeDirection.Out, txID))
        {
Console.WriteLine ("Client received: " + rx.ReadByte ());
tx.WriteByte (200); }
}
static void AnonymousPipeServer () {
        using var tx = new AnonymousPipeServerStream (
                         PipeDirection.Out, HandleInheritability.Inheritable);
        using var rx = new AnonymousPipeServerStream (
                         PipeDirection.In, HandleInheritability.Inheritable);
        string txID = tx.GetClientHandleAsString ();
        string rxID = rx.GetClientHandleAsString ();
// Create and start up a child process.
// We'll use the same Console executable, but pass in arguments: string thisAssembly = Assembly.GetEntryAssembly().Location; string thisExe = Path.ChangeExtension (thisAssembly, ".exe"); var args = $"{txID} {rxID}";
var startInfo = new ProcessStartInfo (thisExe, args);
        startInfo.UseShellExecute = false;       // Required for child process
        Process p = Process.Start (startInfo);

        tx.DisposeLocalCopyOfClientHandle ();    // Release unmanaged
        rx.DisposeLocalCopyOfClientHandle ();    // handle resources.
        tx.WriteByte (100);    // Send a byte to the child process
        Console.WriteLine ("Server received: " + rx.ReadByte ());
        p.WaitForExit ();
      }
}
As with named pipes, the client and server must coordinate their sending and receiving and agree on the length of each transmission. Anonymous pipes don’t, unfortunately, support message mode, so you must implement your own protocol for message length agreement. One solution is to send, in the first four bytes of each transmission, an integer value defining the length of the message to follow. The BitConverter class provides methods for converting between an integer and an array of four bytes.
