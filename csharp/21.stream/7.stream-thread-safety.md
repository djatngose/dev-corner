# Thread Safety
As a rule, `streams are not thread-safe, meaning that two threads cannot concur‐ rently read or write to the same stream without possible error.` The Stream class offers a simple workaround via the static Synchronized method. This method accepts a stream of any type and returns a thread-safe wrapper. The wrapper works by obtaining an exclusive lock around each read, write, or seek, ensuring that only one thread can perform such an operation at a time. In practice, this allows multiple threads to simultaneously append data to the same stream—other kinds of activities (such as concurrent reading) require additional locking to ensure that each thread accesses the desired portion of the stream.
