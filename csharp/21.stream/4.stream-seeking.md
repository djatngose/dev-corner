# Seeking
A stream is seekable if CanSeek returns true. With a seekable stream (such as a file stream), you can query or modify its Length (by calling SetLength) and at any time change the Position at which you’re reading or writing. The Position property is relative to the beginning of the stream; the Seek method, however, allows you to move relative to the current position or the end of the stream.

`Changing the Position on a FileStream typically takes a few microseconds`. If you’re doing this millions of times in a loop, the `MemoryMappedFile` class might be a better choice than a `FileStream` (see “Memory-Mapped Files” on page 712).
With a nonseekable stream (such as an encryption stream), the only way to deter‐ mine its length is to read it completely through. Furthermore, if you need to reread a previous section, you must close the stream and start afresh with a new one.
