# Literals, Punctuators, and Operators
`Literals` are primitive pieces of data lexically embedded into the program. The literals we used in our example program are 12 and 30.

`Punctuators` help demarcate the structure of the program. An example is the semicolon, which terminates a statement. Statements can wrap multiple lines:

Console.WriteLine
  (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10);
An `operator` transforms and combines expressions. Most operators in C# are denoted with a symbol, such as the multiplication operator, *. We discuss operators in more detail later in this chapter. These are the operators we used in our example program:

=  *  .  () 
A period denotes a member of something (or a decimal point with numeric literals). Parentheses are used when declaring or calling a method; empty parentheses are used when the method accepts no arguments. (Parentheses also have other purposes that you’ll see later in this chapter.) An equals sign performs assignment. (The double equals sign, ==, performs equality comparison, as you’ll see later.)
