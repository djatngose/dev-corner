# Contextual keywords
Some keywords are contextual, meaning that you also can use them as identifiersâ€”without an @ symbol:

```
add
alias
and
ascending
async
await
by
descending	dynamic
equals
from
get
global
group
init
into	join
let
managed
nameof
nint
not
notnull
nuint	on
or
orderby
partial
remove
select
set
unmanaged	value
var
with
when
where
yield
```
- With contextual keywords, ambiguity cannot arise within the context in which they are used.
