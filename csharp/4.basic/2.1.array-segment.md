# ArraySegment
`ArraySegment<T> `is a class that represents a segment or subrange of an array. It provides `a way to work with a portion of an array without having to create a new array or copy any elements`. It stores a reference to the original array and provides the starting index and length of the segment.

`Array segments can be useful for working with large arrays when you only need to access a subset of the data`. 
  -They can also be useful for passing a portion of an array to a method, instead of passing the entire array.
  - Array segments were commonly used in earlier versions of .NET when slicing arrays was not as performant or easy as it is with the introduction of `Span<T> and Memory<T>`.
