# what is covariant in c#?
Covariance in C# is a feature that allows a method or property to return a derived type that is more specific than the originally specified type. In other words, covariance enables implicit conversion of a more derived type to a less derived type.

Covariance is supported in C# for arrays, delegates, and generic interfaces. To enable covariance in a generic interface, the interface must be marked with the out modifier on the covariant type parameter. Here's an example of a covariant interface:

csharp
Copy code
public interface IAnimal<out T>
{
    T GetAnimal();
}
In this example, the out modifier is used to indicate that the T type parameter is covariant. This means that the GetAnimal method can return a more derived type of T, but it cannot accept a less derived type of T as a parameter.

Here's an example of how you can use the IAnimal interface with covariance:

csharp
Copy code
public class Animal
{
    // Animal class definition
}

public class Dog : Animal
{
    // Dog class definition
}

public class AnimalFactory : IAnimal<Animal>
{
    public Animal GetAnimal()
    {
        return new Animal();
    }
}

public class DogFactory : IAnimal<Dog>
{
    public Dog GetAnimal()
    {
        return new Dog();
    }
}

public class Program
{
    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
        IAnimal<Animal> animalFactory = new AnimalFactory();
        IAnimal<Dog> dogFactory = new DogFactory();

        // Covariant assignment of dogFactory to animalFactory
        animalFactory = dogFactory;

        Animal animal = animalFactory.GetAnimal(); // Returns a Dog object, thanks to covariance
    }
}
In this example, the DogFactory class implements the IAnimal<Dog> interface, which is more specific than the IAnimal<Animal> interface implemented by the AnimalFactory class. Thanks to covariance, we can assign the DogFactory instance to a variable of type IAnimal<Animal>, and the GetAnimal method can return a Dog object even though the variable is of type IAnimal<Animal>.

# Declaring a covariant type parameter
Type parameters on interfaces and delegates can be declared covariant by marking them with the out modifier. This modifier ensures that, unlike with arrays, covariant type parameters are fully type-safe.

We can illustrate this with our Stack<T> class by having it implement the following interface:

public interface IPoppable<out T> { T Pop(); }
The out modifier on T indicates that T is used only in output positions (e.g., return types for methods). The out modifier flags the type parameter as covariant and allows us to do this:

var bears = new Stack<Bear>();
bears.Push (new Bear());
// Bears implements IPoppable<Bear>. We can convert to IPoppable<Animal>:
IPoppable<Animal> animals = bears;   // Legal
Animal a = animals.Pop();
The conversion from bears to animals is permitted by the compiler—by virtue of the type parameter being covariant. This is type-safe because the case the compiler is trying to avoid—pushing a Camel onto the stack—can’t occur, because there’s no way to feed a Camel into an interface where T can appear only in output positions.
Note: Covariance (and contravariance) in interfaces is something that you typically consume: it’s less common that you need to write variant interfaces.

We can leverage the ability to cast covariantly to solve the reusability problem described earlier:

public class ZooCleaner
{
  public static void Wash (IPoppable<Animal> animals) { ... }
}
NOTE
The IEnumerator<T> and IEnumerable<T> interfaces described in Chapter 7 have a covariant T. This allows you to cast IEnumerable<string> to IEnumerable<object>, for instance.

The compiler will generate an error if you use a covariant type parameter in an input position (e.g., a parameter to a method or a writable property).

NOTE
Covariance (and contravariance) works only for elements with reference conversions—not boxing conversions. (This applies both to type parameter variance and array variance.) So, if you wrote a method that accepted a parameter of type IPoppable<object>, you could call it with IPoppable<string> but not IPoppable<int>.

# Contravariance
We previously saw that, assuming that A allows an implicit reference conversion to B, a type X has a covariant type parameter if X<A> allows a reference conversion to X<B>. Contravariance is when you can convert in the reverse direction—from X<B> to X<A>. This is supported if the type parameter appears only in input positions and is designated with the in modifier. Extending our previous example, suppose the Stack<T> class implements the following interface:

public interface IPushable<in T> { void Push (T obj); }
We can now legally do this:

IPushable<Animal> animals = new Stack<Animal>();
IPushable<Bear> bears = animals;    // Legal
bears.Push (new Bear());
No member in IPushable outputs a T, so we can’t get into trouble by casting animals to bears (there’s no way to Pop, for instance, through that interface).

NOTE
Our Stack<T> class can implement both IPushable<T> and IPoppable<T>—despite T having opposing variance annotations in the two interfaces! This works because you must exercise variance through the interface and not the class; therefore, you must commit to the lens of either IPoppable or IPushable before performing a variant conversion. This lens then restricts you to the operations that are legal under the appropriate variance rules.

This also illustrates why classes do not allow variant type parameters: concrete implementations typically require data to flow in both directions.

To give another example, consider the following interface, defined in the System namespace:

public interface IComparer<in T>
{
  // Returns a value indicating the relative ordering of a and b
  int Compare (T a, T b);
}
Because the interface has a contravariant T, we can use an IComparer<object> to compare two strings:

var objectComparer = Comparer<object>.Default;
// objectComparer implements IComparer<object>
IComparer<string> stringComparer = objectComparer;
int result = stringComparer.Compare ("Brett", "Jemaine");
Mirroring covariance, the compiler will report an error if you try to use a contravariant type parameter in an output position (e.g., as a return value or in a readable property).

# What different in and out modifier?

In C#, the in and out modifiers are used to define variance of generic type parameters. Variance refers to the ability of a type to have its generic type argument substituted with a more derived or less derived type.

When a generic type parameter is defined as in, it is said to be contravariant. This means that the type parameter can only be used as input to a method or function, but not as output. When a generic type parameter is defined as out, it is said to be covariant. This means that the type parameter can only be used as output, but not as input.

Here's an example to illustrate this concept:

csharp
Copy code
public interface IAnimal<in TInput, out TOutput>
{
    TOutput GetDetails(TInput animal);
}
In this example, TInput is marked with the in modifier, while TOutput is marked with the out modifier. This means that TInput can only be used as input to the GetDetails method, while TOutput can only be used as output.

Let's say we have two classes, Animal and Dog, where Dog inherits from Animal.

kotlin
Copy code
public class Animal { }

public class Dog : Animal
{
    public string Breed { get; set; }
}
Now, let's implement the IAnimal interface using these classes:

csharp
Copy code
public class AnimalDetails : IAnimal<Animal, string>
{
    public string GetDetails(Animal animal)
    {
        return $"This animal has {animal.Legs} legs";
    }
}

public class DogDetails : IAnimal<Dog, object>
{
    public object GetDetails(Dog dog)
    {
        return new { Breed = dog.Breed, Legs = dog.Legs };
    }
}
In this example, AnimalDetails implements the IAnimal interface with type arguments Animal and string, while DogDetails implements it with type arguments Dog and object.

The GetDetails method of AnimalDetails takes an Animal as input and returns a string. The GetDetails method of DogDetails takes a Dog as input and returns an anonymous object with properties for the dog's breed and number of legs.

Now, let's create instances of these classes and call the GetDetails method:

java
Copy code
AnimalDetails animalDetails = new AnimalDetails();
DogDetails dogDetails = new DogDetails();

Animal animal = new Animal();
Dog dog = new Dog { Breed = "Labrador", Legs = 4 };

string animalDetailsString = animalDetails.GetDetails(animal);
object dogDetailsObject = dogDetails.GetDetails(dog);
In this example, we create instances of AnimalDetails and DogDetails, and then create instances of Animal and Dog. We call the GetDetails method of AnimalDetails with an Animal as input, and store the result in a string variable. We call the GetDetails method of DogDetails with a Dog as input, and store the result in an object variable.

The animalDetails.GetDetails method can accept any Animal or any more derived type of Animal as input, because the TInput parameter of the IAnimal interface is marked with the in modifier. The dogDetails.GetDetails method can return any object that is an object or any less derived type of object, because the TOutput parameter of the `IAnimal

# C# Generics Versus C++ Templates
C# generics are similar in application to C++ templates, but they work very differently. In both cases, a synthesis between the producer and consumer must take place in which the placeholder types of the producer are filled in by the consumer. However, with C# generics, producer types (i.e., open types such as List<T>) can be compiled into a library (such as mscorlib.dll). This works because the synthesis between the producer and the consumer that produces closed types doesn’t actually happen until runtime. With C++ templates, this synthesis is performed at compile time. This means that in C++ you don’t deploy template libraries as .dlls—they exist only as source code. It also makes it difficult to dynamically inspect, let alone create, parameterized types on the fly.

To dig deeper into why this is the case, consider again the Max method in C#:

static T Max <T> (T a, T b) where T : IComparable<T>
  => a.CompareTo (b) > 0 ? a : b;
Why couldn’t we have implemented it like this?

static T Max <T> (T a, T b)
  => (a > b ? a : b);             // Compile error
The reason is that Max needs to be compiled once and work for all possible values of T. Compilation cannot succeed because there is no single meaning for > across all values of T—in fact, not every T even has a > operator. In contrast, the following code shows the same Max method written with C++ templates. This code will be compiled separately for each value of T, taking on whatever semantics > has for a particular T and failing to compile if a particular T does not support the > operator:

template <class T> T Max (T a, T b)
{
  return a > b ? a : b;
}
