# JsonConvert.SerializeObject and JsonConvert.DeserializeObject create a copy data?

`JsonConvert.SerializeObject and JsonConvert.DeserializeObject` both create new strings or byte arrays to represent the JSON data. So, while they use the original data to create the new representation, they do create a copy of the data.

If you have a performance-critical application that deals with large amounts of JSON data, using `Span<T> and Memory<T>` to process the data directly without creating a copy could potentially provide a performance benefit. However, it also requires careful management of the lifetime of the underlying data to ensure that it remains valid for as long as it is being used.
