# Sending Mail with SmtpClient

The SmtpClient class in the System.Net.Mail namespace allows you to send mail messages through the ubiquitous Simple Mail Transfer Protocol, or SMTP. To send

a simple text message, instantiate SmtpClient, set its Host property to your SMTP server address, and then call Send:
    SmtpClient client = new SmtpClient();
    client.Host = "mail.myserver.com";
    client.Send ("from@adomain.com", "to@adomain.com", "subject", "body");
Constructing a MailMessage object exposes further options, including the ability to add attachments:
SmtpClient client = new SmtpClient(); client.Host = "mail.myisp.net"; MailMessage mm = new MailMessage();
    mm.Sender = new MailAddress ("kay@domain.com", "Kay");
    mm.From   = new MailAddress ("kay@domain.com", "Kay");
    mm.To.Add  (new MailAddress ("bob@domain.com", "Bob"));
    mm.CC.Add  (new MailAddress ("dan@domain.com", "Dan"));
    mm.Subject = "Hello!";
mm.Body = "Hi there. Here's the photo!"; mm.IsBodyHtml = false;
mm.Priority = MailPriority.High;
Attachment a = new Attachment ("photo.jpg", System.Net.Mime.MediaTypeNames.Image.Jpeg);
    mm.Attachments.Add (a);
    client.Send (mm);
To frustrate spammers, most SMTP servers on the internet will accept connections only from authenticated connections and require communication over SSL:
var client = new SmtpClient ("smtp.myisp.com", 587) {
      Credentials = new NetworkCredential ("me@myisp.com", "MySecurePass"),
EnableSsl = true };
client.Send ("me@myisp.com", "someone@somewhere.com", "Subject", "Body"); Console.WriteLine ("Sent");
By changing the DeliveryMethod property, you can instruct the SmtpClient to instead use IIS to send mail messages or simply to write each message to an .eml file in a specified directory. This can be useful during development:
    SmtpClient client = new SmtpClient();
    client.DeliveryMethod = SmtpDeliveryMethod.SpecifiedPickupDirectory;
    client.PickupDirectoryLocation = @"c:\mail";
