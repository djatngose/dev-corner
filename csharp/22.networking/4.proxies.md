# A proxy server is an intermediary through which HTTP requests can be routed. Organizations sometimes set up a proxy server as the only means by which employ‐ ees can access the internet—primarily because it simplifies security. A proxy has an address of its own and can demand authentication so that only selected users on the LAN can access the internet.
To use a proxy with HttpClient, first create an HttpClientHandler and assign its Proxy property and then feed that into HttpClient’s constructor:
```c#
WebProxy p = new WebProxy ("192.178.10.49", 808);
p.Credentials = new NetworkCredential ("username", "password", "domain");
var handler = new HttpClientHandler { Proxy = p }; var client = new HttpClient (handler);
...
```
HttpClientHandler also has a UseProxy property that you can assign to false instead of nulling out the Proxy property to defeat autodetection.
If you supply a domain when constructing the NetworkCredential, Windows-based authentication protocols are used. To use the currently authenticated Windows user, assign the static CredentialCache.DefaultNetworkCredentials value to the proxy’s Credentials property.
As an alternative to repeatedly setting the Proxy, you can set the global default as follows:
    HttpClient.DefaultWebProxy = myWebProxy;
