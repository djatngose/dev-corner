# List<T> and ArrayList
The generic List and nongeneric ArrayList classes provide a dynamically sized array of objects and are among the most commonly used of the collection classes. ArrayList implements IList, whereas List<T> implements both IList and IList<T> (and the read-only version, IReadOnlyList<T>). Unlike with arrays, all interfaces are implemented publicly, and methods such as Add and Remove are exposed and work as you would expect.

Internally, `List<T> and ArrayList work by maintaining an internal array of objects`, replaced with a larger array upon reaching capacity. `Appending elements is efficient (because there is usually a free slot at the end), but inserting elements can be slow (because all elements after the insertion point must be shifted to make a free slot), as can removing elements (especially near the start)`. As with arrays, searching is efficient if the BinarySearch method is used on a list that has been sorted, but it is otherwise inefficient because each item must be individually checked.

 `NOTE`
List<T> is up to several times faster than ArrayList if T is a value type, because List<T> avoids the overhead of boxing and unboxing elements.
```c#
List<T> and ArrayList provide constructors that accept an existing collection of elements: these copy each element from the existing collection into the new List<T> or ArrayList:

public class List<T> : IList<T>, IReadOnlyList<T>
{
  public List ();
  public List (IEnumerable<T> collection);
  public List (int capacity);

  // Add+Insert
  public void Add         (T item);
  public void AddRange    (IEnumerable<T> collection);
  public void Insert      (int index, T item);
  public void InsertRange (int index, IEnumerable<T> collection);

  // Remove
  public bool Remove      (T item);
  public void RemoveAt    (int index);
  public void RemoveRange (int index, int count);
  public int  RemoveAll   (Predicate<T> match);

  // Indexing
  public T this [int index] { get; set; }
  public List<T> GetRange (int index, int count);
  public Enumerator<T> GetEnumerator();

  // Exporting, copying and converting:
  public T[] ToArray();
  public void CopyTo (T[] array);
  public void CopyTo (T[] array, int arrayIndex);
  public void CopyTo (int index, T[] array, int arrayIndex, int count);
  public ReadOnlyCollection<T> AsReadOnly();
  public List<TOutput> ConvertAll<TOutput> (Converter <T,TOutput>
                                            converter);
  // Other:
  public void Reverse();            // Reverses order of elements in list.
  public int Capacity { get;set; }  // Forces expansion of internal array.
  public void TrimExcess();         // Trims internal array back to size.
  public void Clear();              // Removes all elements, so Count=0.
}

public delegate TOutput Converter <TInput, TOutput> (TInput input);
```
In addition to these members, List<T> provides instance versions of all of Array’s searching and sorting methods.

The following code demonstrates List’s properties and methods (for examples on searching and sorting, see “The Array Class”):
```c#
var words = new List<string>();    // New string-typed list

words.Add ("melon");
words.Add ("avocado");
words.AddRange (new[] { "banana", "plum" } );
words.Insert (0, "lemon");                           // Insert at start
words.InsertRange (0, new[] { "peach", "nashi" });   // Insert at start

words.Remove ("melon");
words.RemoveAt (3);                         // Remove the 4th element
words.RemoveRange (0, 2);                   // Remove first 2 elements

// Remove all strings starting in 'n':
words.RemoveAll (s => s.StartsWith ("n"));

Console.WriteLine (words [0]);                          // first word
Console.WriteLine (words [words.Count - 1]);            // last word
foreach (string s in words) Console.WriteLine (s);      // all words
List<string> subset = words.GetRange (1, 2);            // 2nd->3rd words

string[] wordsArray = words.ToArray();    // Creates a new typed array

// Copy first two elements to the end of an existing array:
string[] existing = new string [1000];
words.CopyTo (0, existing, 998, 2);

List<string> upperCaseWords = words.ConvertAll (s => s.ToUpper());
List<int> lengths = words.ConvertAll (s => s.Length);
```
The nongeneric ArrayList class requires clumsy casts—as the following example demonstrates:
```c#
ArrayList al = new ArrayList();
al.Add ("hello");
string first = (string) al [0];
string[] strArr = (string[]) al.ToArray (typeof (string));
```
Such casts cannot be verified by the compiler; the following compiles successfully but then fails at runtime:
```c#
int first = (int) al [0];    // Runtime exception
```
`NOTE`
An ArrayList is functionally similar to List<object>. Both are useful when you need a list of mixed-type elements that share no common base type (other than object). A possible advantage of choosing an ArrayList, in this case, would be if you need to deal with the list using reflection (Chapter 19). Reflection is easier with a nongeneric ArrayList than a List<object>.
# List access index vs array access index in c#?
In C#, accessing an element by index in an array is generally faster than accessing an element by index in a list. This is because arrays are implemented as a contiguous block of memory, which allows for efficient direct access to any element in the array using an index.

On the other hand, lists are implemented using a dynamically allocated array with additional logic to handle resizing and element insertion/deletion. This means that accessing an element by index in a list involves a bit more overhead than accessing an element in an array. However, lists do have other benefits such as the ability to easily add or remove elements and the ability to resize dynamically as needed.

In general, if you need to frequently access elements by index and the size of the collection is fixed, an array may be a better choice for performance. If you need to frequently add or remove elements, or the size of the collection is likely to change dynamically, a list may be a better choice despite the slightly slower index access.
If you import the System.Linq namespace, you can convert an ArrayList to a generic List by calling Cast and then ToList:
```c#
ArrayList al = new ArrayList();
al.AddRange (new[] { 1, 5, 9 } );
List<int> list = al.Cast<int>().ToList();
```
Cast and ToList are extension methods in the System.Linq.Enumerable class.
# How about insert, update ,remove for List vs Array perfornamce?

`Insertion`:

Inserting an element in the middle of an `Array` `requires shifting all the subsequent elements over by one index to make room for the new element, which can be slow for large arrays.` Inserting an element at the end of an array is fast, as it simply requires updating the last index of the array.
Inserting an element in a `List` is generally faster than in an Array, as it doesn't require shifting elements over. The List implementation can simply insert the new element into the underlying array and update the count.
`Update`:

Updating an element in an `Array` is fast, as you can directly access the element using its index and update it in place.
Updating an element in a `List` requires iterating through the list to find the element, which can be slower than accessing an element in an array by index.
`Removal`:

Removing an element from the middle of an `Array` requires shifting all the subsequent elements over by one index to fill in the gap left by the removed element, which can be slow for large arrays.
Removing an element from a `List` is generally faster than in an Array, as it doesn't require shifting elements over. The List implementation can simply remove the element from the underlying array and update the count.

# list access index vs array access index in c#?
In C#, accessing an element by index in an array is generally faster than accessing an element by index in a list. This is because arrays are implemented as a contiguous block of memory, which allows for efficient direct access to any element in the array using an index.

On the other hand, lists are implemented using a dynamically allocated array with additional logic to handle resizing and element insertion/deletion. This means that accessing an element by index in a list involves a bit more overhead than accessing an element in an array. However, lists do have other benefits such as the ability to easily add or remove elements and the ability to resize dynamically as needed.

In general, if you need to frequently access elements by index and the size of the collection is fixed, an array may be a better choice for performance. If you need to frequently add or remove elements, or the size of the collection is likely to change dynamically, a list may be a better choice despite the slightly slower index access.

# what the mechanism of list access index?
In C#, a list is implemented using a dynamically allocated array. When you access an element in a list by index, the list internally calculates the memory location of the element based on the starting memory address of the array and the index of the element.

For example, if you have a list containing 10 integers, the list's internal array will have 10 memory locations reserved for the integers, starting from a certain memory address. When you access an element in the list by index, the list will calculate the memory location of the element by adding the starting memory address of the array to the product of the index and the size of an integer (since each integer takes up 4 bytes of memory).

Once the list has calculated the memory location of the desired element, it can then retrieve the value stored at that location and return it to the caller. This process of calculating the memory location based on the index and retrieving the value stored at that location can add some overhead compared to directly accessing an element in an array, but the benefits of dynamic resizing and other list-specific functionality may outweigh this cost in many situations.

# list is not contain contiguous block of memory?
That is correct. Unlike arrays, List<T> in C# does not store its elements in a contiguous block of memory. Instead, a List<T> maintains an internal array that can be dynamically resized as needed. When the number of elements in the list exceeds the capacity of the internal array, a new, larger array is allocated and the elements are copied over.

This means that the memory used by a List<T> is not guaranteed to be contiguous, and accessing elements of a List<T> involves an additional level of indirection compared to accessing elements of an array. However, this also means that List<T> can be more flexible and efficient than arrays in certain situations, such as when the number of elements is not known in advance or when elements need to be inserted or removed from the middle of the collection.
# Whan add an element into list, do we need the shift the others?
When adding an element to a List<T>, the internal array of objects that the list maintains might need to be replaced with a larger array upon reaching capacity. If there is room in the internal array, the new element can be added without shifting the others. However, if there is not enough room, a new larger array will be created and all the existing elements will be copied to the new array. So, in that sense, adding elements to a List<T> can involve shifting elements around in memory. But inserting elements in the middle of the list can be especially slow because all the elements after the insertion point must be shifted to make a free slot.
# how about the array, does it need to be shifted?
Yes, when inserting an element in the middle of an array, all the elements after the insertion point must be shifted to make room for the new element. This is because arrays are a contiguous block of memory, where each element is stored in a fixed location in memory. Therefore, if you want to insert an element in the middle of the array, you need to move all the elements after the insertion point one position to the right to make space for the new element. Similarly, if you want to remove an element from the middle of an array, all the elements after the removed element must be shifted one position to the left to fill the gap.
# WHy when call tolist from variable b, the data of variable a also be changed?
```c#
var a = getReadOnlyList();
var b = a.Select(c =>
{
    c.Amount = new Money()
    {
        Value = 222
    };
    return c;
}).ToList();

```
The reason for this is that the Select method returns an IEnumerable that provides a "view" of the original data. When you call ToList on that IEnumerable, it creates a new List containing references to the same objects as the original IEnumerable. This means that when you modify the objects in the new List, you are also modifying the objects in the original IEnumerable.

To prevent this from happening, you can create a new list that contains new instances of the objects, rather than references to the original objects. One way to do this is to use the List constructor that takes an IEnumerable as an argument:
```c#
var a = getReadOnlyList();
var b = new List<SomeClass>(a.Select(c =>
{
    var newObj = new SomeClass(c.Name, new Money { Value = c.Amount.Value });
    newObj.Amount.Value = 222;
    return newObj;
}));

```
This creates a new List containing new instances of the SomeClass objects, rather than references to the original objects. Modifying the objects in the new List will not affect the objects in the original IEnumerable.

# Why  inserting an element into a List<T>-like structure might require moving thousands of existing elements?
When a new element is inserted into a list at a specific position, all the existing elements after that position have to be shifted by one to make space for the new element. For example, consider the following list of integers:
```c#
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

```
If we want to insert the number 6 at index 2, the existing elements from index 2 onwards have to be shifted by one to the right to make space for the new element. This would result in the following list:
```c#
[1, 2, 6, 3, 4, 5]

```
`This operation can be expensive in terms of both time and memory, especially if the list is large`. In contrast, `linked lists` are implemented as a series of nodes that reference each other, so inserting a new element simply requires `creating a new node and updating a couple of references to add it to the list`. `This can be done with minimal copying of existing elements, making it more memory and time efficient for concurrent access.`
