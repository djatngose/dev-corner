# Dictionaries
A dictionary is a collection in which each element is a key/value pair. Dictionaries are most commonly used for lookups and sorted lists.

.NET defines a standard protocol for dictionaries, via the interfaces IDictionary and IDictionary<TKey,TValue>, as well as a set of general-purpose dictionary classes. The classes each differ in the following regard:

  - Whether items are stored in sorted sequence  
  - Whether items can be accessed by position (index) as well as by key
  - Whether generic or nongeneric 
  - Whether it’s fast or slow to retrieve items by key from a large dictionary

The performance times are in milliseconds and based on performing 50,000 operations on a dictionary with integer keys and values on a 1.5 GHz PC. (The differences in performance between generic and nongeneric counterparts using the same underlying collection structure are due to boxing, and show up only with value-type elements.)
```
Type	Internal structure	Retrieve by index?	Memory overhead (avg. bytes per item)	Speed: random insertion	Speed: sequential insertion	Speed: retrieval by key
Unsorted	 	 	 	 	 	 
Dictionary <K,V>	Hashtable	No	22	30	30	20
Hashtable	Hashtable	No	38	50	50	30
ListDictionary	Linked list	No	36	50,000	50,000	50,000
OrderedDictionary	Hashtable + array	Yes	59	70	70	40
Sorted	 	 	 	 	 	 
SortedDictionary <K,V>	Red/black tree	No	20	130	100	120
SortedList <K,V>	2xArray	Yes	2	3,300	30	40
SortedList	2xArray	Yes	27	4,500	100	180
```
`In Big-O notation`, `retrieval time by key` is as follows:
  - O(1) for Hashtable, Dictionary, and OrderedDictionary
  - O(log n) for SortedDictionary and SortedList
  - O(n) for ListDictionary (and nondictionary types such as List<T>)
 n is the number of elements in the collection.

# IDictionary<TKey,TValue>
IDictionary<TKey,TValue> defines the standard protocol for all key/value-based collections. It extends ICollection<T> by adding methods and properties to access elements based on a key of arbitrary type:
```c#
public interface IDictionary <TKey, TValue> :
  ICollection <KeyValuePair <TKey, TValue>>, IEnumerable
{
   bool ContainsKey (TKey key);
   bool TryGetValue (TKey key, out TValue value);
   void Add         (TKey key, TValue value);
   bool Remove      (TKey key);

   TValue this [TKey key]      { get; set; }  // Main indexer - by key
   ICollection <TKey> Keys     { get; }       // Returns just keys
   ICollection <TValue> Values { get; }       // Returns just values
}
```
`Note`: There’s also an interface called IReadOnlyDictionary<TKey,TValue>, which defines the read-only subset of dictionary members.

To add an item to a dictionary, you either call Add or use the index’s set accessor—the latter adds an item to the dictionary if the key is not already present (or updates the item if it is present). `Duplicate keys are forbidden in all dictionary implementations, so calling Add twice with the same key throws an exception.`

To retrieve an item from a dictionary, use either the indexer or the TryGetValue method. If the key doesn’t exist, the indexer throws an exception, whereas TryGetValue returns false. You can test for membership explicitly by calling Contain⁠s​Key; however, this incurs the cost of two lookups if you then subsequently retrieve the item.

Enumerating directly over an IDictionary<TKey,TValue> returns a sequence of KeyValuePair structs:
```c#
public struct KeyValuePair <TKey, TValue>
{
  public TKey Key     { get; }
  public TValue Value { get; }
}
```
You can enumerate over just the keys or values via the dictionary’s Keys/Values properties.

We demonstrate the use of this interface with the generic Dictionary class in the following section.

# IDictionary
The nongeneric IDictionary interface is the same in principle as IDictionary<TKey,TValue>, apart from two important functional differences. It’s important to be aware of these differences, because IDictionary appears in legacy code (including the .NET BCL itself in places):

Retrieving a nonexistent key via the indexer returns null (rather than throwing an exception).

Contains tests for membership rather than ContainsKey.

Enumerating over a nongeneric IDictionary returns a sequence of Dictionary​En⁠try structs:
```c#
public struct DictionaryEntry
{
  public object Key   { get; set; }
  public object Value { get; set; }
}
```

# Dictionary<TKey,TValue> and Hashtable
The generic Dictionary class is one of the most commonly used collections (along with the List<T> collection). It uses a hashtable data structure to store keys and values, and it is fast and efficient.

`Note`: `The nongeneric version of Dictionary<TKey,TValue> is called Hashtable`; there is no nongeneric class called Dictionary. When we refer simply to Dictionary, we mean the generic Dictionary<TKey,TValue> class.

`Dictionary implements both the generic and nongeneric IDictionary interfaces`, the generic IDictionary being exposed publicly. Dictionary is, in fact, a “textbook” implementation of the generic IDictionary.

Here’s how to use it:

```c#
var d = new Dictionary<string, int>();

d.Add("One", 1);
d["Two"] = 2;     // adds to dictionary because "two" not already present
d["Two"] = 22;    // updates dictionary because "two" is now present
d["Three"] = 3;

Console.WriteLine (d["Two"]);                // Prints "22"
Console.WriteLine (d.ContainsKey ("One"));   // true (fast operation)
Console.WriteLine (d.ContainsValue (3));     // true (slow operation)
int val = 0;
if (!d.TryGetValue ("onE", out val))
  Console.WriteLine ("No val");              // "No val" (case sensitive)

// Three different ways to enumerate the dictionary:

foreach (KeyValuePair<string, int> kv in d)          //  One; 1
  Console.WriteLine (kv.Key + "; " + kv.Value);      //  Two; 22
                                                     //  Three; 3

foreach (string s in d.Keys) Console.Write (s);      // OneTwoThree
Console.WriteLine();
foreach (int i in d.Values) Console.Write (i);       // 1223

```

`Its underlying hashtable works by converting each element’s key into an integer hashcode—a pseudo-unique value—and then applying an algorithm to convert the hashcode into a hash key`. This hash key is used internally to determine which “bucket” an entry belongs to. If the bucket contains more than one value, a linear search is performed on the bucket. A good hash function does not strive to return strictly unique hashcodes (which would usually be impossible); it strives to return hashcodes that are evenly distributed across the 32-bit integer space. This prevents the scenario of ending up with a few very large (and inefficient) buckets.

Sure! Here's an example to illustrate the importance of having a good hash function in a dictionary:

Let's say we have a dictionary with 5 buckets and the following keys and hash codes:
```c#
Key	Hash Code
"apple"	3
"banana"	3
"orange"	3
"pear"	3
"grape"	3
```
If we use a bad hash function that always returns 3, then all the keys will be put into the same bucket. This means that when we try to retrieve a value based on a key, the dictionary has to search through all 5 keys in the bucket to find the right one. This is inefficient and defeats the purpose of using a dictionary.

On the other hand, if we use a good hash function that distributes the keys evenly across the 5 buckets, then each bucket will have only 1 key, and retrieving a value based on a key will be much faster. For example:
```c#
Key	Hash Code
"apple"	1
"banana"	2
"orange"	3
"pear"	4
"grape"	5
```
With a good hash function, the dictionary can easily find the bucket that contains the key we're looking for, and we only need to search through one key to find the value we need.
# Here's an example of how a Dictionary works:

Let's say we have a Dictionary with the following key-value pairs:

```c#
Dictionary<string, int> dict = new Dictionary<string, int>();
dict.Add("apple", 5);
dict.Add("banana", 10);
dict.Add("orange", 15);
```
When we add elements to the Dictionary, the Dictionary generates a hashcode for each key using a hash function. The hash function converts each key into a pseudo-unique hashcode.

For example, the hash function might generate the following hashcodes for our keys:
```c#
"apple": 123456
"banana": 987654
"orange": 345678
```
The hashcodes are then converted into hash keys, which are used internally to determine which "bucket" each entry belongs to. The number of buckets is determined by the size of the Dictionary, which grows dynamically as more elements are added.

For example, let's say our Dictionary has 8 buckets:

```c#
bucket 0: empty
bucket 1: ("banana", 10)
bucket 2: empty
bucket 3: ("orange", 15)
bucket 4: ("apple", 5)
bucket 5: empty
bucket 6: empty
bucket 7: empty
```
As we can see, the entries are distributed across the buckets based on their hash keys. When we look up a value by key, the Dictionary first computes the hashcode for the key, and then uses the hash key to find the appropriate bucket. If there is more than one value in the bucket (which is called a "collision"), the Dictionary performs a linear search to find the value with the matching key.

For example, if we look up the value for key "banana", the Dictionary would compute the hashcode for "banana" (987654), and use the hash key to find the bucket (bucket 1). It would then perform a linear search of the values in bucket 1 to find the value with the matching key ("banana", 10).

A dictionary can work with keys of any type, providing it’s able to determine equality between keys and obtain hashcodes. By default, equality is determined via the key’s object.Equals method, and the pseudo-unique hashcode is obtained via the key’s GetHashCode method. You can change this behavior either by overriding these methods or by providing an IEqualityComparer object when constructing the dictionary. A common application of this is to specify a case-insensitive equality comparer when using string keys:
```c#
var d = new Dictionary<string, int> (StringComparer.OrdinalIgnoreCase);
```
As with many other types of collections, you can improve the performance of a dictionary slightly by specifying the collection’s expected size in the constructor, avoiding or lessening the need for internal resizing operations.

The nongeneric version is named Hashtable and is functionally similar apart from differences stemming from it exposing the nongeneric IDictionary interface discussed previously.

`The downside to Dictionary and Hashtable is that the items are not sorted`. Furthermore, the original order in which the items were added is not retained. As with all dictionaries, duplicate keys are not allowed.

`NOTE`
When the generic collections were introduced back in 2005, the CLR team chose to name them according to what they represent (Dictionary, List) rather than how they are internally implemented (Hashtable, ArrayList). Although this is good because it gives them the freedom to later change the implementation, it also means that the performance contract (often the most important criteria in choosing one kind of collection over another) is no longer captured in the name.

# OrderedDictionary
An OrderedDictionary is a nongeneric dictionary that maintains elements in the same order that they were added. With an OrderedDictionary, you can access elements both by index and by key.

`NOTE`
An OrderedDictionary is not a sorted dictionary.

An OrderedDictionary is a combination of a Hashtable and an ArrayList. This means that it has all the functionality of a Hashtable, plus functions such as RemoveAt and an integer indexer. It also exposes Keys and Values properties that return elements in their original order.

This class was introduced in .NET 2.0, yet, peculiarly, there’s no generic version.

# ListDictionary and HybridDictionary
ListDictionary uses a singly linked list to store the underlying data. It doesn’t provide sorting, although it does preserve the original entry order of the items. ListDictionary is extremely slow with large lists. Its only real “claim to fame” is its efficiency with very small lists (fewer than 10 items).

HybridDictionary is a ListDictionary that automatically converts to a Hashtable upon reaching a certain size, to address ListDictionary’s problems with performance. The idea is to get a low memory footprint when the dictionary is small and good performance when the dictionary is large. However, given the overhead in converting from one to the other—and the fact that a Dictionary is not excessively heavy or slow in either scenario—you wouldn’t suffer unreasonably by using a Dictionary to begin with.

Both classes come only in nongeneric form.

# Sorted Dictionaries
The .NET BCL provides two dictionary classes internally structured such that their content is always sorted by key:

SortedDictionary<TKey,TValue>

SortedList<TKey,TValue>1

(In this section, we abbreviate <TKey,TValue> to <,>.)

SortedDictionary<,> uses a red/black tree: a data structure designed to perform consistently well in any insertion or retrieval scenario.

SortedList<,> is implemented internally with an ordered array pair, providing fast retrieval (via a binary-chop search) but poor insertion performance (because existing values need to be shifted to make room for a new entry).

SortedDictionary<,> is much faster than SortedList<,> at inserting elements in a random sequence (particularly with large lists). SortedList<,>, however, has an extra ability: to access items by index as well as by key. With a sorted list, you can go directly to the nth element in the sorting sequence (via the indexer on the Keys/Values properties). To do the same with a SortedDictionary<,>, you must manually enumerate over n items. (Alternatively, you could write a class that combines a sorted dictionary with a list class.)

None of the three collections allows duplicate keys (as is the case with all dictionaries).

The following example uses reflection to load all of the methods defined in System.Object into a sorted list keyed by name and then enumerates their keys and values:

// MethodInfo is in the System.Reflection namespace

var sorted = new SortedList <string, MethodInfo>();

foreach (MethodInfo m in typeof (object).GetMethods())
  sorted [m.Name] = m;

foreach (string name in sorted.Keys)
  Console.WriteLine (name);

foreach (MethodInfo m in sorted.Values)
  Console.WriteLine (m.Name + " returns a " + m.ReturnType);
Here’s the result of the first enumeration:

Equals
GetHashCode
GetType
ReferenceEquals
ToString
Here’s the result of the second enumeration:

Equals returns a System.Boolean
GetHashCode returns a System.Int32
GetType returns a System.Type
ReferenceEquals returns a System.Boolean
ToString returns a System.String
Notice that we populated the dictionary through its indexer. If we instead used the Add method, it would throw an exception because the object class upon which we’re reflecting overloads the Equals method, and you can’t add the same key twice to a dictionary. By using the indexer, the later entry overwrites the earlier entry, preventing this error.

You can store multiple members of the same key by making each value element a list:

SortedList <string, List<MethodInfo>>

Extending our example, the following retrieves the MethodInfo whose key is "GetHashCode", just as with an ordinary dictionary:

Console.WriteLine (sorted ["GetHashCode"]);      // Int32 GetHashCode()
So far, everything we’ve done would also work with a SortedDictionary<,>. The following two lines, however, which retrieve the last key and value, work only with a sorted list:

Console.WriteLine (sorted.Keys  [sorted.Count - 1]);            // ToString
Console.WriteLine (sorted.Values[sorted.Count - 1].IsVirtual);  // True
# when to use Dictionary, OrderedDictionary , SortedDictionary and SortedList in c#?
Use `Dictionary` if you need to store key/value pairs and do not care about the order in which they are stored.
Use `OrderedDictionary` if you need to store key/value pairs and need to maintain the order in which they were added to the dictionary.
Use `SortedDictionary` if you need to store key/value pairs and want to retrieve them in sorted order based on the keys.
Use `SortedList` if you need to store key/value pairs and want to retrieve them in sorted order based on the keys, and also need to access elements by their index.

In general, if you do not need to maintain the order of the items in the dictionary or sort them based on the keys, Dictionary is usually the most efficient choice. If you need to maintain the order in which the items were added, use OrderedDictionary. If you need to sort the items based on the keys, use SortedDictionary or SortedList.
