# dotnet-dump
A dump, sometimes called a core dump, is a snapshot of the state of a process’s virtual memory. You can dump a running process on demand, or configure the OS to generate a dump when an application crashes.
On Ubuntu Linux, the following command enables a core dump upon application crash (the necessary steps can vary between different flavors of Linux):
    ulimit -c unlimited
On Windows, use regedit.exe to create or edit the following key in the local machine hive:
    SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows\Windows Error Reporting\LocalDumps
Under that, add a key with the same name as your executable (e.g., foo.exe), and under that key, add the following keys:
• DumpFolder (REG_EXPAND_SZ), with a value indicating the path to which you want dump files written
• DumpType (REG_DWORD), with a value of 2 to request a full dump
• (Optionally) DumpCount (REG_DWORD), indicating the maximum number of
dump files before the oldest is removed
To install the tool, run the following command:
    dotnet tool install --global dotnet-dump
After you’ve installed it, you can initiate a dump on demand (without ending the process), as follows:
dotnet-dump collect --process-id <<YourProcessId>>

The following command starts an interactive shell for analyzing a dump file:
dotnet-dump analyze <<dumpfile>>
If an exception took down the application, you can use the printexceptions com‐ mand (pe for short) to display details of that exception. The dotnet-dump shell sup‐ ports numerous additional commands, which you can list with the help command.
