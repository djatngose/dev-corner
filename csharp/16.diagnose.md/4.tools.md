# Cross-Platform Diagnostic Tools
In this section, we briefly describe the cross-platform diagnostic tools available to .NET:
# `dotnet-counters`
Provides an overview of the state of a running application
 Suppose you have a .NET Core application that is experiencing high CPU usage. You can use dotnet-counters to monitor the application's CPU usage in real-time and identify which parts of the application are causing the high CPU usage. For example, you could monitor the Process\% Processor Time counter to see which process is consuming the most CPU, or the ASP.NET Core\Requests/sec counter to see how many requests the application is processing per second.
 

# `dotnet-trace`
For more detailed performance and event monitoring
Suppose you have a .NET Core application that is crashing intermittently. You can use dotnet-trace to capture diagnostic information about the application and try to identify the cause of the crashes. For example, you could use the Microsoft-DotNETCore-SampleProfiler provider to profile the application's performance and identify any performance bottlenecks that could be causing the crashes.
# `dotnet-dump`
To obtain a memory dump on demand or after a crash
These tools do not require administrative elevation and are suitable for both devel‚Äê opment and production environments.
Suppose you have a .NET Core application that is experiencing high memory usage. You can use dotnet-dump to capture a memory dump of the application and analyze it to identify the source of the high memory usage. For example, you could use the dumpheap command to see which objects are consuming the most memory, or the gcroot command to see which objects are keeping other objects from being garbage collected.
