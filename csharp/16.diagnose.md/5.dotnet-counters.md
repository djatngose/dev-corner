# dotnet-counters
The dotnet-counters tool monitors the memory and CPU usage of a .NET process and writes the data to the console (or a file).
To install the tool, run the following from a command prompt or terminal with dotnet in the path:
    dotnet tool install --global dotnet-counters
You can then start monitoring a process, as follows:
dotnet-counters monitor System.Runtime --process-id <<ProcessID>>
System.Runtime means that we want to monitor all counters under the System.Run‚Äê time category. You can specify either a category or counter name (the dotnet- counters list command lists all available categories and counters).

The output is continually refreshed and looks like this:
```c#
    Press p to pause, r to resume, q to quit.
