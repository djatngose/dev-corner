Secure and `HttpOnly are flags` that can be set on HTTP cookies to enhance their security.

#  HttpOnly flag
The `HttpOnly` flag is used to `prevent JavaScript code from accessing the cookie`. This is important because if a cookie is accessible via JavaScript, it can be stolen by an attacker using a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack. When the `HttpOnly` flag is set, the cookie can only be accessed by the server, and cannot be read or modified by JavaScript running on the client side.

Together, the `Secure` and `HttpOnly` flags can help to protect cookies from various types of attacks, including CSRF, XSS, and session hijacking.

#  Secure flag
The `Secure` flag is used to ensure that cookies are only sent over HTTPS connections, rather than over unencrypted HTTP connections. This helps to prevent attackers from intercepting the cookie and using it to hijack the user's session. When the `Secure` flag is set, the browser will only send the cookie over an HTTPS connection, and will not send it over an unencrypted HTTP connection.
