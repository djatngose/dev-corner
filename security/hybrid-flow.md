# use cases for hybrid and authorization flow?
se Cases for the `Hybrid Flow`:

Single Sign-On (SSO): The Hybrid Flow is often used in scenarios where you want to implement Single Sign-On (SSO) across multiple applications. By obtaining the ID token along with the authorization code, you can validate the user's identity and avoid redundant authentication for each application in the ecosystem.

User Profile Enrichment: If your application needs additional user-related information beyond basic authentication, such as the user's name, email, or profile picture, the Hybrid Flow allows you to retrieve the ID token, which contains such information. This can help in customizing the user experience based on their profile data.

Separation of Authentication and Authorization: The Hybrid Flow provides the flexibility to separate the authentication and authorization steps. This can be useful if you want to authenticate the user with an external identity provider (e.g., social login) and then handle the authorization and access token exchange with your own server-side application.

Use Cases for the `Authorization Code Flow`:

Server-Side Applications: The Authorization Code Flow is well-suited for server-side applications, such as web applications or APIs. It allows for secure handling of tokens on the server-side, as the access token is not exposed to the client-side application.

Refresh Token Usage: If your application needs long-lived access to resources without requiring user interaction, the Authorization Code Flow supports the usage of refresh tokens. With refresh tokens, the client application can obtain new access tokens when the current one expires, providing a seamless user experience.

Enhanced Security: The Authorization Code Flow offers better security compared to the Implicit Flow, as the access token is not exposed to the client-side application. The exchange of the authorization code for access tokens on the server-side ensures that sensitive tokens are kept secure.
