# The most commonly used design patterns in real-life software development are the following:

`Model-View-Controller (MVC)` pattern: This pattern is widely used in web development to separate the data model, user interface, and control logic into separate components.

`Singleton` pattern: This pattern is used to ensure that a class has only one instance and provides a single point of access to it.

`Factory pattern`: This pattern is used to create objects without specifying the exact class of object that will be created.

`Observer pattern`: This pattern is used to allow objects to observe the state changes in other objects and be notified when those changes occur.

`Decorator pattern`: This pattern is used to add new behaviors to existing objects dynamically by wrapping them in decorator objects.
`
Facade pattern:` This pattern is used to provide a simplified interface to a complex system.

`Command pattern:` This pattern is used to encapsulate method invocations in objects and pass them as method arguments.

These are some of the most commonly used design patterns in software development and are widely used across different programming languages and platforms. The choice of design pattern depends on the specific requirements and constraints of the project and the experience and preferences of the developer.
