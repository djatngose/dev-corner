# Intro
We will keep earning and growing a little of knowledge every day. I will collect my knowledge and years of working experiences to contribute this page to help people can gain a deep understanding of the code that we are working on instead of a surface such as just coding and runing not completely understand the functionalities behind the scene

# C#
The content is inspired mostly by the book: [C# 10 in a Nutshell of the publisher: O'Reilly Media](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/c-10-in/9781098121945/). I also collect a lot of info throught working experience and research and interview questions as well
