# what the suitable message lock duration ?
The suitable message lock duration in Azure Service Bus can vary depending on the specific requirements of your application.

The message lock duration determines the amount of time that a message is locked for processing by a receiver. During this time, no other receiver can lock or process the same message. If the receiver does not complete processing the message before the lock duration expires, the message becomes available for other receivers to process.

A shorter message lock duration can provide better throughput for your application, as it allows for more concurrent processing of messages. However, it can also increase the risk of message duplication if a receiver fails to complete processing before the lock expires.

On the other hand, a longer message lock duration can reduce the risk of message duplication, but it can also reduce the overall throughput of your application.

As a general rule of thumb, a message lock duration of `30 seconds to 1 minute` is commonly used in Azure Service Bus. However, you should consider adjusting the lock duration based on the characteristics and requirements of your specific application, such as the expected processing time of your messages and the level of concurrency needed for your receivers.
